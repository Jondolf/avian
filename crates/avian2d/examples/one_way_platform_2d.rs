/// Allows entities to pass through [`OneWayPlatform`] entities.

/// Passing through is achieved by removing the collisions between the [`OneWayPlatform`]
/// and the other entity if the entity should pass through.
/// If a [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform`] is present on the non-platform entity,
/// the value of the component dictates the pass-through behaviour.
///
/// Entities known to be passing through each [`OneWayPlatform`] are stored in the
/// [`OneWayPlatform`]. If an entity is known to be passing through a [`OneWayPlatform`],
/// it is allowed to continue to do so, even if [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform`] has been
/// set to disallow passing through.
///
/// > Note that this is a very simplistic implementation of one-way
/// > platforms to demonstrate filtering collisions via [`PostProcessCollisions`].
/// > You will probably want something more robust to implement one-way
/// > platforms properly, or may elect to use a sensor collider for your entities instead,
/// > which means you won't need to filter collisions at all.
///
/// #### When an entity is known to already be passing through the [`OneWayPlatform`]
/// Any time an entity begins passing through a [`OneWayPlatform`], it is added to the
/// [`OneWayPlatform`]'s set of currently active penetrations, and will be allowed to
/// continue to pass through the platform until it is no longer penetrating the platform.
///
/// The entity is allowed to continue to pass through the platform as long as at least
/// one contact is penetrating.
///
/// Once all of the contacts are no longer penetrating the [`OneWayPlatform`], or all contacts
/// have stopped, the entity is forgotten about and the logic falls through to the next part.
///
/// #### When an entity is NOT known to be passing through the [`OneWayPlatform`]
/// Depending on the setting of [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform`], the entity may be allowed to
/// pass through.
///
/// If no [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform`] is present, [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform::ByNormal`] is used.
///
/// [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform`] may be in one of three states:
/// 1. [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform::ByNormal`]
///     - This is the default state
///     - The entity may be allowed to pass through the [`OneWayPlatform`] depending on the contact normal
///         - If all contact normals are in line with the [`OneWayPlatform`]'s local-space up vector,
///           the entity is allowed to pass through
/// 2. [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform::Always`]
///     - The entity will always pass through the [`OneWayPlatform`], regardless of contact normal
///     - This is useful for allowing an entity to jump down through a platform
/// 3. [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform::Never`]
///     - The entity will never pass through the [`OneWayPlatform`], meaning the platform will act
///       as normal hard collision for this entity
///
/// Even if an entity is changed to [`PassThroughOneWayPlatform::Never`], it will be allowed to pass
/// through a [`OneWayPlatform`] if it is already penetrating the platform. Once it exits the platform,
/// it will no longer be allowed to pass through.
