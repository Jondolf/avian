//! Contains joints.
//!
//! **Joints** are a way to connect entities in a way that restricts their movement relative to each other.
//! They act as [constraints] that restrict different *Degrees Of Freedom* depending on the joint type.
//!
//! ## Degrees Of Freedom (DOF)
//!
//! In 3D, entities can normally translate and rotate along the `X`, `Y` and `Z` axes.
//! Therefore, they have 3 translational DOF and 3 rotational DOF, which is a total of 6 DOF.
//!
//! Joints reduce the number of DOF that entities have. For example, [revolute joints](RevoluteJoint)
//! only allow rotation around one axis.
//!
//! Below is a table containing the joints that are currently implemented.
//!
//! | Joint              | Allowed 2D DOF            | Allowed 3D DOF              |
//! | ------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
//! | [`FixedJoint`]     | None                      | None                        |
//! | [`DistanceJoint`]  | 1 Translation, 1 Rotation | 2 Translations, 3 Rotations |
//! | [`PrismaticJoint`] | 1 Translation             | 1 Translation               |
//! | [`RevoluteJoint`]  | 1 Rotation                | 1 Rotation                  |
//! | [`SphericalJoint`] | 1 Rotation                | 3 Rotations                 |
//!
//! ## Using joints
//!
//! In Bevy XPBD, joints are modeled as components. You can create a joint by simply spawning
//! an entity and adding the joint component you want, giving the connected entities as arguments
//! to the `new` method.
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
//! # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
//! # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
//! # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
//! #
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     let entity1 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//!     let entity2 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//!     
//!     // Connect the bodies with a fixed joint
//!     commands.spawn(FixedJoint::new(entity1, entity2));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Stiffness
//!
//! You can control the stiffness of a joint with the `with_compliance` method.
//! *Compliance* refers to the inverse of stiffness, so using a compliance of 0 corresponds to
//! infinite stiffness.
//!
//! ### Attachment positions
//!
//! By default, joints are connected to the centers of entities, but attachment positions can be used to change this.
//!
//! You can use `with_local_anchor_1` and `with_local_anchor_2` to set the attachment positions on the first
//! and second entity respectively.
//!
//! ### Damping
//!
//! You can configure the linear and angular damping caused by joints using the `with_linear_velocity_damping` and
//! `with_angular_velocity_damping` methods. Increasing the damping values will cause the velocities
//! of the connected entities to decrease faster.
//!
//! ### Other configuration
//!
//! Different joints may have different configuration options. Many joints allow you to change the axis of allowed
//! translation or rotation, and they may have distance or angle limits along these axes.
//!
//! Take a look at the documentation and methods of each joint to see all of the configuration options.
//!
//! ## Custom joints
//!
//! Joints are [constraints] that implement [`Joint`] and [`XpbdConstraint`].
//!
//! The process of creating a joint is essentially the same as [creating a constraint](constraints#custom-constraints),
//! except you should also implement the [`Joint`] trait's methods. The trait has some useful helper methods
//! like `align_position` and `align_orientation` to reduce some common boilerplate.
//!
//! Many joints also have joint limits. You can use [`DistanceLimit`] and [`AngleLimit`] to help store these limits
//! and to compute the current distance from the specified limits.
//!
//! [See the code implementations](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/tree/main/src/constraints/joints)
//! of the implemented joints to get a better idea of how to create joints.
