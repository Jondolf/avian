//!
//! # Constraints
//!
//! **Constraints** are a way to model physical relationships between entities. They are an integral part of XPBD, and they can be used
//! for things like [contact resolution](PenetrationConstraint), [joints], soft bodies, and much more.
//!
//! At its core, a constraint is just a rule that is enforced by moving the participating entities in a way that satisfies that rule.
//! For example, a distance constraint is satisfied when the distance between two entities is equal to the desired distance.
//!
//! Most constraints in Bevy XPBD are modeled as seperate entities with a component that implements [`XpbdConstraint`].
//! They contain a `solve` method that receives the states of the participating entities as parameters.
//! You can find more details on how to use each constraint by taking a look at their documentation.
//!
//! Below are the currently implemented constraints.
//!
//! - [`PenetrationConstraint`](PenetrationConstraint)
//! - [Joints](joints)
//!     - [`FixedJoint`]
//!     - [`DistanceJoint`]
//!     - [`SphericalJoint`]
//!     - [`RevoluteJoint`]
//!     - [`PrismaticJoint`]
//!
//! More constraint types will be added in future releases. If you need more constraints now, consider
//! [creating your own constraints](custom-constraints).
//!
//! ## Custom constraints
//!
//! In Bevy XPBD, you can easily create your own constraints using the same APIs that the engine uses for its own constraints.
//!
//! First, create a struct and implement the [`XpbdConstraint`] trait, giving the number of participating entities using generics.
//! It should look similar to this:
//!
//! ```
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
//! # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
//! # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
//! use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
//!
//! struct CustomConstraint {
//!     entity1: Entity,
//!     entity2: Entity,
//!     lagrange: f32,
//! }
//!
//! #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
//! impl XpbdConstraint<2> for CustomConstraint {
//!     fn entities(&self) -> [Entity; 2] {
//!         [self.entity1, self.entity2]
//!     }
//!     fn clear_lagrange_multipliers(&mut self) {
//!         self.lagrange = 0.0;
//!     }
//!     fn solve(&mut self, bodies: [&mut RigidBodyQueryItem; 2], dt: f32) {
//!         // Constraint solving logic goes here
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Take a look at [`XpbdConstraint::solve`] and the constraint [theory](#theory) to learn more about what to put in `solve`.
//!
//! Next, we need to add a system that solves the constraint during each run of the [solver]. If your constraint is
//! a component like most of Bevy XPBD's constraints, you can use the generic [`solve_constraint`] system that handles
//! some of the background work for you.
//!
//! Add the `solve_constraint::<YourConstraint, ENTITY_COUNT>` system to the
//! [substepping schedule's](SubstepSchedule) [`SubstepSet::SolveUserConstraints`] set. It should look like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Get substep schedule
//! let substeps = app
//!     .get_schedule_mut(SubstepSchedule)
//!     .expect("add SubstepSchedule first");
//!
//! // Add custom constraint
//! substeps.add_systems(
//!     solve_constraint::<CustomConstraint, 2>.in_set(SubstepSet::SolveUserConstraints),
//! );
//! ```
//!
//! Now just spawn an instance of the constraint, give it the participating entities, and the constraint should be getting
//! solved automatically according to the `solve` method!
//!
//! You can find a working example of a custom constraint
//! [here](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/blob/main/crates/bevy_xpbd_3d/examples/custom_constraint.rs).
//!
//! ## Theory
//!
//! In this section, you can learn some of the theory behind how constraints work. Understanding the theory and maths isn't
//! important for using constraints, but it can be useful if you want to [create your own constraints](#custom-constraints).
//!
//! **Note**: In the following theory, primarily the word "particle" is used, but the same logic applies to normal
//! [rigid bodies](RigidBody) as well. However, unlike particles, rigid bodies can also have angular quantities such as
//! [rotation](Rotation) and [angular inertia](Inertia), so constraints can also affect their orientation. This is explained
//! in more detail [at the end](#rigid-body-constraints).
//!
//! ### Constraint functions
//!
//! At the mathematical level, each constraint has a *constraint function* `C(x)` that takes the state
//! of the particles as parameters and outputs a scalar value. The goal of the constraint is to move the particles
//! in a way that the output *satisfies* a constraint equation.
//!
//! For *equality constraints* the equation takes the form `C(x) = 0`. In other words, the constraint tries to
//! *minimize* the value of `C(x)` to be as close to zero as possible. When the equation is true, the constraint is *satisfied*.
//!
//! For a distance constraint, the constraint function would be `C(x) = distance - rest_distance`,
//! because this would be zero when the distance is equal to the desired rest distance.
//!
//! For *inequality constraints* the equation instead takes the form `C(x) >= 0`. These constraints are only applied
//! when `C(x) < 0`, which is useful for things like static friction and [joint limits](joints#joint-limits).
//!
//! ### Constraint gradients
//!
//! To know what directions the particles should be moved towards, constraints compute a *constraint gradient* `▽C(x)`
//! for each particle. It is a vector that points in the direction in which the constraint function value `C` increases the most.
//! The length of the gradient indicates how much `C` changes when moving the particle by one unit. This is often equal to one.
//!
//! In a case where two particles are being constrained by a distance constraint, and the particles are outside of the
//! rest distance, the gradient vector would point away from the other particle, because it would increase the distance
//! even further.
//!
//! ### Lagrange multipliers
//!
//! In the context of constraints, a Lagrange multiplier `λ` corresponds to the signed magnitude of the constraint force.
//! It is a scalar value that is the same for all of the constraint's participating particles, and it is used for computing
//! the correction that the constraint should apply to the particles along the gradients.
//!
//! In XPBD, the Lagrange multiplier update `Δλ` during a substep is computed by dividing the opposite of `C`
//! by the sum of the products of the inverse masses and squared gradient lengths plus an additional compliance term:
//!
//! ```text
//! Δλ = -C / (sum(w_i * |▽C_i|^2) + α / h^2)
//! ```
//!
//! where `w_i` is the inverse mass of particle `i`, `|▽C_i|` is the length of the gradient vector for particle `i`,
//! `α` is the constraint's compliance (inverse of stiffness) and `h` is the [substep size](SubDeltaTime). Using `α = 0`
//! corresponds to infinite stiffness.
//!
//! The minus sign is there because the gradients point in the direction in which `C` increases the most,
//! and we instead want to minimize `C`.
//!
//! Note that if the gradients are normalized, as is often the case, the squared gradient lengths can be omitted from the
//! calculation.
//!
//! ### Solving constraints
//!
//! Once we have computed the Lagrange multiplier `λ`, we can compute the positional correction for a given particle
//! as the product of the Lagrange multiplier and the particle's inverse mass and gradient vector:
//!
//! ```text
//! Δx_i = Δλ * w_i * ▽C_i
//! ```
//!
//! In other words, we typically move the particle along the gradient by `Δλ` proportional to the particle's inverse mass.
//!
//! ### Rigid body constraints
//!
//! Unlike particles, [rigid bodies](RigidBody) also have angular quantities like [rotation](Rotation),
//! [angular velocity](AngularVelocity) and [angular inertia](Inertia). In addition, constraints can be applied at specific
//! points in the body, like [contact positions](Contact) or joint attachment positions, which also affects the orientation.
//!
//! When the constraint is not applied at the center of mass, the inverse mass in the computation of `Δλ` must
//! be replaced with a *generalized inverse mass* that is essentially the effective mass when applying the constraint
//! at some specified position.
//!
//! For a positional constraint applied at position `r_i`, the generalized inverse mass computation for body `i` looks like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! w_i = 1 / m_i + (r_i x ▽C_i)^T * I_i^-1 * (r_i x ▽C_i)
//! ```
//!
//! where `m_i` is the [mass](Mass) of body `i`, `I_i^-1` is the [inverse inertia tensor](InverseInertia), and `^T` refers to the
//! transpose of a vector. Note that the value of the inertia tensor depends on the orientation of the body, so it should be
//! recomputed each time the constraint is solved.
//!
//! For an angular constraint where the gradient vector is the rotation axis, the generalized inverse mass computation instead
//! looks like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! w_i = ▽C_i^T * I_i^-1 * ▽C_i
//! ```
//!
//! Once we have computed the Lagrange multiplier update, we can apply the positional correction as shown in the
//! [previous section](#solving-constraints).
//!
//! However, angular constraints are handled differently. If the constraint function's value is the rotation angle and
//! the gradient vector is the rotation axis, we can compute the angular correction for a given body like this:
//!
//! ```text
//! Δq_i = 0.5 * [I_i^-1 * (r_i x (Δλ * ▽C_i)), 0] * q_i
//! ```
//!
//! where `q_i` is the [rotation](Rotation) of body `i` and `r_i` is a vector pointing from the body's center of mass to some
//! attachment position.
