/// The number of substeps used in the simulation.
///
/// A higher number of substeps reduces the value of [`Time`],
/// which results in a more accurate simulation, but also reduces performance. The default
/// substep count is currently 12.
///
/// If you use a very high substep count and encounter stability issues, consider enabling the `f64`
/// feature as shown in the [getting started guide](crate#getting-started) to avoid floating point
/// precision problems.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// You can change the number of substeps by inserting the [`SubstepCount`] resource:
///
/// ```no_run
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
///
/// fn main() {
///     App::new()
///         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::default()))
///         .insert_resource(SubstepCount(30))
///         .run();
/// }
