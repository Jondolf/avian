//! Joints limit the degrees of freedom that bodies can have. For example, a [`RevoluteJoint`] or hinge
//! prevents any relative movement between two bodies, except for rotation about a single axis
//! at an anchor point.
//!
//! Below is a table containing all joints that are currently implemented.

//!
//! # Using Joints
//!
//! In Avian, joints are modeled as components. Each joint is spawned as its own entity,
//! providing the [`Entity`] identifiers of the bodies it should constrain.
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     let body1 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//!     let body2 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//!     
//!     // Connect the bodies with a fixed joint.
//!     commands.spawn(FixedJoint::new(body1, body2));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! By default, the attached bodies can still collide with each other.
//! This behavior can be disabled with the [`JointCollisionDisabled`] component.
//!
//! ## Joint Frames
//!
//! By default, joints use body transforms as their reference for how to constrain the connected bodies.
//! For example, a [`RevoluteJoint`] aims to make the positions of the two bodies coincide in world space,
//! while allowing the bodies to rotate freely around a common axis.
//!
//! However, it can often be useful to define the attachment point or orientation separately from the body transform.
//! For example, you may want the [`RevoluteJoint`] to be attached to the corner of a body instead of its center,
//! and that the other body is rotated by 90 degrees relative to the first body.
//!
//! This can be done by configuring the [`JointFrame`] associated with each body. Each joint frame is expressed
//! by a local [`JointAnchor`] and [`JointBasis`] relative to the transforms of the bodies. The anchor determines
//! the attachment point, while the basis determines the orientation of the joint frame relative to the body transform.
//!
#![doc = include_str!("./images/joint_frame.svg")]
//!
//! Storing the frames in local space allows the initial configuration to be preserved even when the bodies are moved.
//! The frames can also be specified in global coordinates using [`JointFrame::global`], but they are automatically converted
//! to local frames during the next simulation step.
//!
//! Below is an example of configuring [`JointFrame`]s for a [`RevoluteJoint`].
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use core::f32::consts::PI;
//! #
//! # #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
//! # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//! #     let body1 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//! #     let body2 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//! #
//! // Connect two bodies with a revolute joint.
//! // Set the global anchor point and rotate the first frame by 45 degrees about the local z axis.
//! commands.spawn((
//!     RevoluteJoint::new(body1, body2)
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "        .with_anchor(Vec2::new(5.0, 2.0))")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "        .with_anchor(Vec3::new(5.0, 2.0, 0.0))")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "        .with_local_basis1(PI / 4.0),")]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "        .with_local_basis1(Quat::from_rotation_z(PI / 4.0)),"
)]
//! ));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Damping
//!
//! By default, no work is done to dampen the movement of bodies connected by a joint.
//! A pendulum will swing indefinitely, unless explicitly stopped or it loses energy due to simulation inaccuracies.
//!
//! It can often be desirable to dampen the relative velocities of bodies connected by a joint to slow them down over time.
//! This can be done using the [`JointDamping`] component.
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//! #     let body1 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//! #     let body2 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//! #
//! // Connect two bodies with a distance joint.
//! // Apply linear and angular damping to the joint.
//! commands.spawn((
//!     DistanceJoint::new(body1, body2),
//!     JointDamping {
//!         linear: 0.1,  // Linear damping
//!         angular: 0.1, // Angular damping
//!     },
//! ));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Reading Joint Forces
//!
//! Joints apply forces and torques to constrain the bodies they are attached to.
//! These forces can be read by adding the [`JointForces`] component to the joint entity:
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//! #     let body1 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//! #     let body2 = commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic).id();
//! #
//! // Connect two bodies with a revolute joint.
//! // Read the forces applied by the joint.
//! commands.spawn((
//!     RevoluteJoint::new(body1, body2),
//!     JointForces::new(),
//! ));
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! and querying for it in a system:
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! fn read_joint_forces(query: Query<&JointForces>) {
//!     for joint_forces in &query {
//!         println!("Joint force: {}", joint_forces.force());
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This can often be useful for determining when to "break" a joint with the [`JointDisabled`] component
//! when its forces exceed a certain threshold. An example of this can be found in the next section on disabling joints.
//!
//! ## Disabling Joints
//!
//! It can sometimes be useful to temporarily disable a joint without removing it from the world.
//! This can be done by adding the [`JointDisabled`] component to the joint entity.
//!
//! A common use case is to "break" a joint when its [`JointForces`] exceed a certain threshold.
//! This could be done with a system like the following:
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! const BREAK_THRESHOLD: f32 = 500.0; // Example threshold
//!
//! # #[cfg(feature = "f32")]
//! fn break_joints(
//!     mut commands: Commands,
//!     query: Query<(Entity, &JointForces), Without<JointDisabled>>,
//! ) {
//!     for (entity, joint_forces) in &query {
//!         if joint_forces.force().length() > BREAK_THRESHOLD {
//!             // Break the joint by adding the `JointDisabled` component.
//!             // Alternatively, you could simply remove the joint component or despawn the entity.
//!            commands.entity(entity).insert(JointDisabled);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Disabled joints can be re-enabled by removing the [`JointDisabled`] component.
//!
//! ## Other Configuration
//!
//! Different joints may have different configuration options. They may allow you to change the axis of allowed
//! translation or rotation, and can have distance or angle limits for those axes.
//!
//! Take a look at the documentation and methods of each joint to see all the different configuration options.
