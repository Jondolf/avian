/// Manages and solves contacts, joints, and other constraints.
///
/// Note that the [`ContactConstraints`] are currently generated by tbe [`NarrowPhasePlugin`].
///
/// # Implementation
///
/// The solver primarily uses TGS Soft, an impulse-based solver with substepping and [soft constraints](softness_parameters).
/// Warm starting is used to improve convergence, along with a relaxation pass to reduce overshooting.
///
/// [Speculative collision](dynamics::ccd#speculative-collision) is used by default to prevent tunneling.
/// Optional [sweep-based Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)](dynamics::ccd#swept-ccd) is handled by the [`CcdPlugin`].
///
/// [Joints](joints) and user constraints are currently solved using [Extended Position-Based Dynamics (XPBD)](xpbd).
/// In the future, they may transition to an impulse-based approach as well.
///
/// # Steps
///
/// Below are the main steps of the `SolverPlugin`.
///
/// 1. [Generate and prepare constraints](collision::narrow_phase::NarrowPhaseSet::GenerateConstraints)
/// 2. Substepping loop (runs the [`SubstepSchedule`] [`SubstepCount`] times)
///     1. [Integrate velocities](super::integrator::IntegrationSet::Velocity)
///     2. [Warm start](SubstepSolverSet::WarmStart)
///     3. [Solve constraints with bias](SubstepSolverSet::SolveConstraints)
///     4. [Integrate positions](super::integrator::IntegrationSet::Position)
///     5. [Solve constraints without bias to relax velocities](SubstepSolverSet::Relax)
///     6. [Solve XPBD constraints (joints)](SubstepSolverSet::SolveXpbdConstraints)
///     7. [Solve user-defined constraints](SubstepSolverSet::SolveUserConstraints)
///     8. [Update velocities after XPBD constraint solving.](SubstepSolverSet::XpbdVelocityProjection)
/// 3. [Apply restitution](SolverSet::Restitution)
/// 4. [Finalize positions by applying](SolverSet::ApplyTranslation) [`AccumulatedTranslation`]
/// 5. [Store contact impulses for next frame's warm starting](SolverSet::StoreContactImpulses)
