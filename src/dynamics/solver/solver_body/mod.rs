// The `SolverBody` layout is inspired by `b2BodyState` in Box2D v3.

/// Optimized rigid body state that the solver operates on,
/// designed to improve memory locality and performance.
///
/// Only awake dynamic bodies and kinematic bodies have an associated solver body,
/// stored as a component on the body entity. Static bodies and sleeping dynamic bodies
/// do not move, so they instead use a "dummy state" with [`SolverBody::default()`].
///
/// # Representation
///
/// The solver doesn't have access to the position or rotation of static or sleeping bodies,
/// which is a problem when computing constraint anchors. To work around this, we have two options:
///
/// - **Option 1**: Use delta positions and rotations. This requires preparing
///   base anchors and other necessary positional data in world space,
///   and computing the updated anchors during substeps.
/// - **Option 2**: Use full positions and rotations. This requires storing
///   anchors in world space for static bodies and sleeping bodies,
///   and in local space for dynamic bodies.
///
/// Avian uses **Option 1**, because:
///
/// - Using delta positions reduces round-off error when bodies are far from the origin.
/// - Mixing world space and local space values depending on the body type would be
///   quite confusing and error-prone, and would possibly require more branching.
///
/// In addition to the delta position and rotation, we also store the linear and angular velocities
/// and some (currently unused) flags. This all fits in 32 bytes in 2D or 56 bytes in 3D with the `f32` feature.
///
/// The 2D data layout has been designed to support fast conversion to and from
/// wide SIMD types via scatter/gather operations in the future when SIMD optimizations
/// are implemented.

/*
Box2D v3 stores mass and angular inertia in constraint data.
For 2D, this is just 2 floats or 8 bytes for each body in each constraint.

However, we also support 3D and locking translational axes, so our worst case
would be *9* floats for each body, 3 for the effective mass vector
and 6 for the symmetric 3x3 inertia tensor. Storing 36 bytes
for each body in each constraint would be quite wasteful.

Instead, we store a separate `SolverBodyInertia` struct for each `SolverBody`.
The struct is optimized for memory locality and size.

In 2D, we store the effective inertial properties directly:

- Effective inverse mass (8 bytes)
- Effective inverse angular inertia (4 bytes)
- Flags (4 bytes)

for a total of 16 bytes.

In 3D, we instead compute the effective versions on the fly:

- Inverse mass (4 bytes)
- Inverse angular inertia (36 bytes, matrix with 9 floats)
- Flags (4 bytes)

for a total of 44 bytes. This will be 32 bytes in the future
if/when we switch to a symmetric 3x3 matrix representation.

The API abstracts over this difference in representation to reduce complexity.
