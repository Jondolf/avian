/// A marker component indicating that a [`RigidBody`] is sleeping and not simulated until woken up again.
///
/// # What is Sleeping?
///
/// Simulating a large number of bodies can be expensive. To reduce CPU overhead, bodies that come to rest
/// enter a low-cost "sleeping" state where they are not simulated until woken up again.
///
/// To start sleeping, the [`LinearVelocity`] and [`AngularVelocity`] of a body must remain below the [`SleepThreshold`]
/// for a time specified by the [`TimeToSleep`] resource. All bodies that are either directly or indirectly connected
/// to the body through contacts or joints must also be allowed to sleep.
///
/// A body is woken up when any of the following happens:
///
/// - An awake body collides with a sleeping body.
/// - A joint is created between an awake body and a sleeping body.
/// - A joint or contact is removed from a sleeping body.
/// - The [`Transform`], [`LinearVelocity`], or [`AngularVelocity`] of a sleeping body is modified.
/// - The [`RigidBody`] type of a body is changed.
/// - A [constant force component](super::forces#constant-forces) of a sleeping body is modified.
/// - A force, impulse, or acceleration is applied via [`Forces`], without using [`non_waking`].
/// - The [`Gravity`] resource or [`GravityScale`] component is modified.
///
/// A body and all bodies connected to it can also be forced to sleep or wake up
/// by manually adding or removing the [`Sleeping`] component, or by using
/// the [`SleepBody`] and [`WakeBody`] commands.
///
/// Sleeping can be disabled for an entity by adding the [`SleepingDisabled`] component.

/// # Implementation Details
///
/// Sleeping in Avian is handled using [simulation islands]. Each island is a collection of bodies
/// that are connected through contacts or joints. An island is only allowed to sleep if all of its bodies are resting,
/// and if any body in a sleeping island is woken up, the entire island is woken up with it.
///
/// The [`IslandPlugin`] is responsible for managing islands, and the [`IslandSleepingPlugin`]
/// is responsible for island sleeping and waking.
