/// A non-deformable body used for the simulation of most physics objects.
///
/// # Rigid Body Types
///
/// A rigid body can be either dynamic, kinematic or static.
///
/// - **Dynamic bodies** are similar to real life objects and are affected by forces and contacts.
/// - **Kinematic bodies** can only be moved programmatically, which is useful for things like character controllers and moving platforms.
/// - **Static bodies** can not move, so they can be good for objects in the environment like the ground and walls.
///
/// # Creation
///
/// Creating a rigid body is as simple as adding the [`RigidBody`] component,
/// and an optional [`Collider`]:
///
/// ```
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::prelude::*;

/// fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
///     // Spawn a dynamic rigid body and specify its position.
///     commands.spawn((
///         RigidBody::Dynamic,
///         Collider::capsule(0.5, 1.5),
///         Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 3.0, 0.0),
///     ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// By default, dynamic rigid bodies will have mass properties computed based on the attached colliders
/// and their [`ColliderDensity`]. See the [Mass properties](#mass-properties) section for more information.
///
/// # Movement
///
/// A rigid body can be moved in three ways: by modifying its position directly,
/// by changing its velocity, or by applying forces or impulses.
///
/// To change the position of a rigid body, you can simply modify its `Transform`:
///
/// ```

///     for mut transform in query.iter_mut() {
///         transform.translation.x += 0.1;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// However, moving a dynamic body by changing its position directly is similar
/// to teleporting the body, which can result in unexpected behavior since the body can move
/// inside walls.
///
/// You can instead change the velocity of a dynamic or kinematic body with the [`LinearVelocity`]

/// # Mass Properties
///
/// Every dynamic rigid body has [mass], [angular inertia], and a [center of mass].
/// These mass properties determine how the rigid body responds to forces and torques.
///
/// - **Mass**: Represents resistance to linear acceleration. A higher mass requires more force for the same acceleration.
/// - **Angular Inertia**: Represents resistance to angular acceleration. A higher angular inertia requires more torque for the same angular acceleration.
/// - **Center of Mass**: The average position of mass in the body. Applying forces at this point produces no torque.
///
/// Static and kinematic rigid bodies have infinite mass and angular inertia,
/// and do not respond to forces or torques. Zero mass for a dynamic body is also
/// treated as a special case, and corresponds to infinite mass.
///
/// If no mass properties are set, they are computed automatically from attached colliders
/// based on their shape and density.
