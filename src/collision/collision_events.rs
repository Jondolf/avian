//! Collision events for detecting when colliders start or stop touching.
//!
//! Avian provides two collision event types:
//!
//! - [`CollisionStart`]: Triggered when two colliders start touching.
//! - [`CollisionEnd`]: Triggered when two colliders stop touching.
//!
//! Depending on your use case, you may want to read them as [`Message`]s with a [`MessageReader`],
//! or observe them as [`Event`]s with an [observer](Observer). Avian supports both options.
//!
//! # Reading Collision Events
//!
//! To enable collision events for a collider entity, add the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! #[derive(Component)]
//! struct PressurePlate;
//!
//! fn setup_pressure_plates(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     commands.spawn((
//!         PressurePlate,
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "        Collider::rectangle(1.0, 1.0),")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "        Collider::cuboid(1.0, 0.1, 1.0),")]
//!         Sensor,
//!         // Enable collision events for this entity.
//!         CollisionEventsEnabled,
//!     ));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The [`CollisionStart`] and [`CollisionEnd`] events will now be both written as a [`Message`]
//! and triggered as an [`Event`] when the entity starts or stops touching another collider.
//! It is up to you to decide which event processing method is best suited for your use case.
//!
//! ## Collision `Message`
//!
//! Reading collision events as [`Message`]s with a [`MessageReader`] can be very efficient
//! for processing large numbers of collisions between pairs of entities, such as for detecting
//! bullet hits or playing impact sounds when two objects collide.
//!
//! The events are only written if one of the entities has the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! fn print_started_collisions(mut collision_reader: MessageReader<CollisionStart>) {
//!     for event in collision_reader.read() {
//!         println!("{} and {} started colliding", event.collider1, event.collider2);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Collision `Event`
//!
//! Observing collision events as [`Event`]s with an [observer](Observer) can be very useful
//! for entity-specific collision scenarios, such as for detecting when a player steps on
//! a pressure plate or enters a trigger volume.
//!
//! The events are only triggered if the target entity has the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! ```
