//! Collision events for detecting when colliders start or stop touching.
//!
//! Depending on your use case, you may want to use either buffered events read
//! using an [`EventReader`] or observable events triggered for specific entities.
//! Avian provides both options using separate event types.
//!
//! Note that collision events are only sent or triggered for entities that have
//! the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! # Buffered Events
//!
//! Avian provides two different buffered collision event types:
//!
//! - [`CollisionStarted`]
//! - [`CollisionEnded`]
//!
//! These events are sent when two colliders start or stop touching, and can be read
//! using an [`EventReader`]. This can be useful for efficiently processing large numbers
//! of collision events between pairs of entities, such as for detecting bullet hits
//! or playing impact sounds when two objects collide.
//!
//! The events are only sent if one of the entities has the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! ```

//!
//! # Observable Events
//!
//! Avian provides two observable collision event types:
//!
//! - [`OnCollisionStart`]
//! - [`OnCollisionEnd`]
//!
//! These events are triggered for [observers](Observer) when two colliders start or stop touching.
//! This makes them good for entity-specific collision scenarios, such as for detecting when a player
//! steps on a pressure plate or enters a trigger volume.

//! The events are only triggered if the target entity has the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
