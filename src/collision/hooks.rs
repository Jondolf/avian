//! Collision hooks for filtering and modifying contacts.

//! See the [`CollisionHooks`] trait for more information.

use crate::prelude::*;
use bevy::{ecs::system::ReadOnlySystemParam, prelude::*};

/// A trait for user-defined hooks that can filter and modify contacts.
///
/// This can be useful for advanced contact scenarios, such as:
///
/// - One-way platforms
/// - Conveyor belts
/// - Non-uniform friction and restitution
///
/// Collision hooks are more flexible than built-in filtering options like [`CollisionLayers`],
/// but can be more complicated to define, and can have slightly more overhead.
/// It is recommended to use hooks only when existing options are not sufficient.
///
/// Only one set of collision hooks can be defined per broad phase and narrow phase.
///
/// # Defining Hooks
///
/// Collision hooks can be defined by implementing the [`CollisionHooks`] trait for a type
/// that implements [`SystemParam`]. The system parameter allows the hooks to do things like
/// access resources, query for components, and perform [spatial queries](crate::spatial_query).
///
/// Note that mutable access is not allowed for the system parameter, as hooks may be called
/// during parallel iteration. However, access to [`Commands`] is provided for deferred changes.
///
/// Below is an example of using collision hooks to implement interaction groups and one-way platforms:
///
/// ```
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::{ecs::system::SystemParam, prelude::*};
///
/// /// A component that groups entities for interactions. Only entities in the same group can collide.
/// #[derive(Component)]
/// struct InteractionGroup(u32);
///
/// /// A component that marks an entity as a one-way platform.
/// #[derive(Component)]
/// struct OneWayPlatform;
///
/// // Define a `SystemParam` for the collision hooks.
/// #[derive(SystemParam)]
/// struct MyHooks<'w, 's> {
///     interaction_query: Query<'w, 's, &'static InteractionGroup>,
///     platform_query: Query<'w, 's, &'static Transform, With<OneWayPlatform>>,
/// }
///
/// // Implement the `CollisionHooks` trait.
/// impl CollisionHooks for MyHooks<'_, '_> {
///     fn filter_pairs(&self, entity1: Entity, entity2: Entity, _commands: &mut Commands) -> bool {
///         // Only allow collisions between entities in the same interaction group.
///         // This could be a basic solution for "multiple physics worlds" that don't interact.
///         let Ok([group1, group2]) = self.interaction_query.get_many([entity1, entity2]) else {
///            return true;
///         };
///         group1.0 == group2.0
///     }
///
///     fn modify_contacts(&self, contacts: &mut Contacts, _commands: &mut Commands) -> bool {
///         // Allow entities to pass through the bottom and sides of one-way platforms.
///         // See the `one_way_platform_2d` example for a full implementation.
///         let (entity1, entity2) = (contacts.entity1, contacts.entity2);
///         !is_hitting_top_of_platform(entity1, entity2, &self.platform_query, &contacts)
///     }
/// }
/// #
/// # fn is_hitting_top_of_platform(
/// #     entity1: Entity,

/// #     platform_query: &Query<&Transform, With<OneWayPlatform>>,
/// #     contacts: &Contacts,
/// # ) -> bool {

/// Collision hooks can access the ECS quite freely, but there are a few limitations:
///
/// - Only one set of collision hooks can be defined per broad phase and narrow phase.
/// - Only read-only ECS access is allowed for the hook system parameter. Use the provided [`Commands`] for deferred ECS operations.
///   - Note that command execution order is unspecified if the `parallel` feature is enabled.
/// - Access to the [`ContactGraph`] resource is not allowed inside [`CollisionHooks::filter_pairs`].
///   Trying to access it will result in a panic.
/// - Access to the [`ContactGraph`] resource is not allowed inside [`CollisionHooks::modify_contacts`].
///   Trying to access it will result in a panic.
