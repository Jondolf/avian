//! Collision detection for [`Collider`]s.
//!
//! Collision detection involves determining pairs of objects that may currently be in contact
//! (or are expected to come into contact), and computing contact data for each intersection.
//! These contacts are then used by the [solver](dynamics::solver) to generate [`ContactConstraint`]s
//! and finally resolve overlap.
//!
//! [`ContactConstraint`]: dynamics::solver::contact::ContactConstraint
//!
//! # Plugins
//!
//! In Avian, collision detection is split into two plugins:
//!
//! - [`BroadPhasePlugin`]: Finds pairs of entities with overlapping [AABBs](ColliderAabb) to reduce the number of potential contacts for the [narrow phase](narrow_phase).
//! - [`NarrowPhasePlugin`]: Updates and manages contact pairs in the [`ContactGraph`], and generates [`ContactConstraint`]s for the solver.
//!
//! Spatial queries are handled separately by the [`SpatialQueryPlugin`].
//!
//! You can also find several utility methods for computing contacts in the [`contact_query`](collider::contact_query) module.
//!
//! # Accessing Collisions
//!
//! Contact pairs found by Avian are stored in the [`ContactGraph`] resource.
//! It contains all contacs between entities with overlapping [`ColliderAabb`]s,
//! including contacts where the colliders themselves may not be touching.
//!
//! To make it easier to access relevant collision data, Avian provides a [`Collisions`]
//! system parameter that only provides touching contacts. This is a light wrapper
//! around the [`ContactGraph`] that can often be more convenient to use.
//!
//! See the documentation of [`Collisions`] for more information and usage examples.
//!
//! # Collision Events
//!
//! Collision events can be used for detecting when colliders start or stop touching.
//!
//! Avian provides two buffered collision event types that can be read using an [`EventReader`](bevy::ecs::event::EventReader):
//!
//! - [`CollisionStarted`]
//! - [`CollisionEnded`]
//!
//! These events are good for efficiently processing large numbers of collision events between pairs of entities,
//! such as for detecting bullet hits or playing impact sounds when two objects collide.
//!
//! Avian also provides two collision event types that are triggered for observers:
//!
//! - [`OnCollisionStart`]
//! - [`OnCollisionEnd`]
//!
//! These events are good for entity-specific collision scenarios, such as for detecting when a player
//! steps on a pressure plate or enters a trigger volume.
//!
//! Collision events are only sent or triggered for entities that have the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! See the documentation of the event types and the [`collision_events`] module
//! for more information and usage examples.
//!
//! # Contact Filtering and Modification
//!
//! Some advanced contact scenarios may need to filter or modify contacts
//! with user-defined logic. This can include:
//!
//! - One-way platforms
//! - Conveyor belts
//! - Non-uniform friction and restitution
//!
//! In Avian, this can be done by defining [`CollisionHooks`]. They let you hook into
//! the collision pipeline, and filter or modify contacts with (almost) full ECS access.
//!
//! See the documentation of [`CollisionHooks`] for more information and usage examples.
