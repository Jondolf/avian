//! Collision detection for [`Collider`]s.
//!
//! Collision detection involves determining pairs of objects that may currently be in contact
//! (or are expected to come into contact), and computing contact data for each intersection.
//! These contacts are then used by the [solver](dynamics::solver) to generate
//! [`ContactConstraint`](dynamics::solver::contact::ContactConstraint)s and finally resolve overlap.
//!
//! In Avian, collision detection is split into three plugins:
//!
//! - [`BroadPhasePlugin`]: Performs intersection tests to determine potential collisions, adding them to [`BroadCollisionPairs`].
//! - [`NarrowPhasePlugin`]: Computes [`Contacts`] for each pair in [`BroadCollisionPairs`], adding them to [`Collisions`].
//! - [`ContactReportingPlugin`] (optional): Sends collision events and updates [`CollidingEntities`] based on [`Collisions`].
//!
//! Spatial queries are handled separately by the [`SpatialQueryPlugin`].
//!
//! You can also find several utility methods for computing contacts in [`contact_query`].

// TODO: Refactor this into a contact graph.
// Collisions are stored in an `IndexMap` that uses fxhash.
// It should have faster iteration than a `HashMap` while mostly retaining other performance characteristics.

// ==========================================
/// A resource that stores all collision pairs.
///
/// # Querying Collisions
///
/// The following methods can be used for querying existing collisions:
///
/// - [`get`](Self::get) and [`get_mut`](Self::get_mut)
/// - [`iter`](Self::iter) and [`iter_mut`](Self::iter_mut)
/// - [`contains`](Self::contains)
/// - [`collisions_with_entity`](Self::collisions_with_entity) and
///   [`collisions_with_entity_mut`](Self::collisions_with_entity_mut)
///
/// Collisions can be accessed at almost any time, but modifications to contacts should be performed
/// in the [`PostProcessCollisions`] schedule or in [`CollisionHooks`].
///
/// # Filtering and Modifying Collisions
///
/// Advanced collision filtering and modification can be done using [`CollisionHooks`].
/// See its documentation for more information.
///
/// # Implementation Details
///
/// Internally, the collisions are stored in an `IndexMap` that contains collisions from both the current frame
/// and the previous frame, which is used for things like [collision events](ContactReportingPlugin#collision-events).
///
/// However, the public methods only use the current frame's collisions. To access the internal data structure,
/// you can use [`get_internal`](Self::get_internal) or [`get_internal_mut`](Self::get_internal_mut).
