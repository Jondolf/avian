//! Collision detection for [`Collider`]s.
//!
//! Collision detection involves determining pairs of objects that may currently be in contact
//! (or are expected to come into contact), and computing contact data for each intersection.
//! These contacts are then used by the [solver](dynamics::solver) to generate [`ContactConstraint`]s
//! and finally resolve overlap.
//!
//! [`ContactConstraint`]: dynamics::solver::contact::ContactConstraint
//!
//! # Plugins
//!
//! In Avian, collision detection is split into two plugins:
//!
//! - [`BroadPhasePlugin`]: Finds pairs of entities with overlapping [AABBs](ColliderAabb) to reduce the number of potential contacts for the [narrow phase](narrow_phase).
//! - [`NarrowPhasePlugin`]: Updates and manages contact pairs in the [`ContactGraph`], and generates [`ContactConstraint`]s for the solver.
//!
//! Spatial queries are handled separately by the [`SpatialQueryPlugin`].
//!
//! You can also find several utility methods for computing contacts in the [`contact_query`](collider::contact_query) module.
//!
//! # Accessing Collisions
//!
//! Contact pairs found by Avian are stored in the [`ContactGraph`] resource.
//! It contains all contacs between entities with overlapping [`ColliderAabb`]s,
//! including contacts where the colliders themselves may not be touching.
//!
//! To make it easier to access relevant collision data, Avian provides a [`Collisions`]
//! system parameter that only provides touching contacts. This is a light wrapper
//! around the [`ContactGraph`] that can often be more convenient to use.
//!
//! See the documentation of [`Collisions`] for more information and usage examples.
//!
//! # Collision Events
//!
//! [Collision events](collision_events) can be used for detecting when colliders start or stop touching.
//!
//! Avian provides two collision event types:
//!
//! - [`CollisionStart`]: Triggered when two colliders start touching.
//! - [`CollisionEnd`]: Triggered when two colliders stop touching.
//!
//! Depending on your use case, you may want to read them as [`Message`]s with a [`MessageReader`],
//! or observe them as [`Event`]s with an [observer]. Avian supports both options.
//!
//! Collision events are only sent or triggered for entities that have the [`CollisionEventsEnabled`] component.
//!
//! See the documentation of the event types and the [`collision_events`] module
//! for more information and usage examples.
//!
//! [`Message`]: bevy::ecs::message::Message
//! [`MessageReader`]: bevy::ecs::message::MessageReader
//! [`Event`]: bevy::ecs::event::Event
//! [observer]: bevy::ecs::observer::Observer
//!
//! # Contact Filtering and Modification
//!
//! Some advanced contact scenarios may need to filter or modify contacts
//! with user-defined logic. This can include:
//!
//! - One-way platforms
//! - Conveyor belts
//! - Non-uniform friction and restitution
//!
//! In Avian, this can be done by defining [`CollisionHooks`]. They let you hook into
//! the collision pipeline, and filter or modify contacts with (almost) full ECS access.
//!
//! See the documentation of [`CollisionHooks`] for more information and usage examples.
