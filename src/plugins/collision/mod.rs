//! Collision detection is used to detect and compute intersections between [`Collider`]s.
//!
//! In `bevy_xpbd`, collision detection is split into three plugins:
//!
//! - [`BroadPhasePlugin`]: Collects pairs of potentially colliding entities into [`BroadCollisionPairs`].
//! - [`NarrowPhasePlugin`]: Computes contacts for broad phase collision pairs and adds them to [`Collisions`].
//! - [`ContactReportingPlugin`] (optional): Sends collision events and updates [`CollidingEntities`] based on [`Collisions`].
//!
//! Spatial queries are handled by the [`SpatialQueryPlugin`].
//!
//! You can also find several utility methods for computing contacts in [`contact_query`].

// Collisions are stored in an `IndexMap` that uses fxhash.
// It should have faster iteration than a `HashMap` while mostly retaining other performance characteristics.
//
// `IndexMap` also preserves insertion order. This can be good or bad depending on the situation,
// but it can make spawned stacks appear more consistent and uniform, for example in the `move_marbles` example.
// ==========================================
/// A resource that stores all collision pairs.
///
/// Each colliding entity pair is associated with [`Contacts`] that can be accessed and modified
/// using the various associated methods.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// [`Collisions`] can be accessed at almost anytime, but for modifying and filtering collisions,
/// it is recommended to use the [`PostProcessCollisions`] schedule. See its documentation
/// for more information.
///
/// ### Querying collisions
///
/// The following methods can be used for querying existing collisions:
///
/// - [`get`](Self::get) and [`get_mut`](Self::get_mut)
/// - [`iter`](Self::iter) and [`iter_mut`](Self::iter_mut)
/// - [`contains`](Self::contains)
/// - [`collisions_with_entity`](Self::collisions_with_entity) and
/// [`collisions_with_entity_mut`](Self::collisions_with_entity_mut)
///
/// The collisions can be accessed at any time, but modifications to contacts should be performed
/// in the [`PostProcessCollisions`] schedule. Otherwise, the physics solver will use the old contact data.
///
/// ### Filtering and removing collisions
///
/// The following methods can be used for filtering or removing existing collisions:
///
/// - [`retain`](Self::retain)
/// - [`remove_collision_pair`](Self::remove_collision_pair)
/// - [`remove_collisions_with_entity`](Self::remove_collisions_with_entity)
///
/// Collision filtering and removal should be done in the [`PostProcessCollisions`] schedule.
/// Otherwise, the physics solver will use the old contact data.
///
/// ### Adding new collisions
///
/// The following methods can be used for adding new collisions:
///
/// - [`insert_collision_pair`](Self::insert_collision_pair)
/// - [`extend`](Self::extend)
///
/// The most convenient place for adding new collisions is in the [`PostProcessCollisions`] schedule.
/// Otherwise, the physics solver might not have access to them in time.
///
/// ## Implementation details
///
/// Internally, the collisions are stored in an `IndexMap` that contains collisions from both the current frame
/// and the previous frame, which is used for things like [collision events](ContactReportingPlugin#collision-events).
///
/// However, the public methods only use the current frame's collisions. To access the internal data structure,
/// you can use [`get_internal`](Self::get_internal) or [`get_internal_mut`](Self::get_internal_mut).
