//! Clocks used for tracking physics simulation time.

use crate::prelude::*;
use bevy::prelude::*;

/// The clock representing physics time, following the [`Time`] clock used by the schedule that physics runs in.
///
/// In [`FixedPostUpdate`] and other fixed schedules, this uses [`Time<Fixed>`](Fixed), while in schedules such as [`Update`],
/// a variable timestep following [`Time<Virtual>`](Virtual) is used.
///
/// [`Time<Physics>`](Physics) is automatically set as the generic [`Time`] resource for
/// the [`PhysicsSchedule`].
///
/// ### Physics speed
///
/// The relative speed of [`Time<Physics>`](Physics) can be configured at startup
/// using [`with_relative_speed`], or when the app is running using [`set_relative_speed`]:
///
/// ```no_run
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::{prelude::*, utils::Duration};
///
/// fn main() {
///     App::new()
///         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::default()))
///         // Run physics at 0.5 speed
///         .insert_resource(Time::<Physics>::default().with_relative_speed(0.5))
///         .run();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// [`with_relative_speed`]: PhysicsTime::with_relative_speed
/// [`set_relative_speed`]: PhysicsTime::set_relative_speed
///
/// ### Pausing, resuming, and stepping physics
///
/// [`Time<Physics>`](Physics) can be used to pause and resume the simulation:
///
/// ```
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
///
/// fn pause(mut time: ResMut<Time<Physics>>) {
///     time.pause();
/// }
///
/// fn unpause(mut time: ResMut<Time<Physics>>) {
///     time.unpause();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To advance the simulation by a certain amount of time instantly, you can advance the
/// [`Time<Physics>`](Physics) clock and manually run the [`PhysicsSchedule`] in an exclusive system:
///
/// ```
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::{prelude::*, utils::Duration};
///
/// fn run_physics(world: &mut World) {
///     // Advance the simulation by 10 steps at 120 Hz
///     for _ in 0..10 {
///         world
///             .resource_mut::<Time<Physics>>()
///             .advance_by(Duration::from_secs_f64(1.0 / 120.0));
///         world.run_schedule(PhysicsSchedule);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## When to multiply by delta time?
///
/// Schedules like `Update` use a variable timestep, which can often cause frame rate dependent
/// behavior when moving bodies. One way to help address the issue is by multiplying by delta time.
///
/// In general, if you're doing a *continuous* operation, you should always multiply by delta time,
/// but for *instantaneous* operations it's not necessary.
///
/// Continuous operations move or accelerate bodies over time:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::math::Vec3;
/// #
/// # let mut position = Vec3::default();
/// # let mut velocity = Vec3::default();
/// # let mut acceleration = Vec3::default();
/// # let mut delta_time = 1.0 / 60.0;
/// #
/// // Move continuously over time
/// position += velocity * delta_time;
/// // Accelerate continuously
/// velocity += acceleration * delta_time;
/// ```
///
/// Instantaneous operations apply a singular sudden burst of velocity
/// or set it to a specific value:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::math::Vec3;
/// #
/// # let mut velocity = Vec3::default();
/// # let mut impulse = Vec3::default();
/// # let mut target_velocity = Vec3::default();
/// #
/// // Apply a burst of speed once (jumps, explosions and so on)
/// velocity += impulse;
/// // Set velocity to a specific value
/// velocity = target_velocity;
/// ```
///
/// For systems using a fixed timestep, using delta time is not necessary for frame rate
/// independence, but it's still recommended so that the physical units are more logical.
