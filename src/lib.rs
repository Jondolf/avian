//! ![Avian Physics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jondolf/avian/avian/assets/branding/logo.svg)
//!
//! **Avian** is an ECS-driven 2D and 3D physics engine for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).
//!
//! Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/avianphysics/avian)
//! for more information about the design, read the [Getting Started](#getting-started)
//! guide below to get up to speed, and take a look at the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
//! for an overview of the engine's features and their documentation.
//!
//! You can also check out the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions), and if you encounter
//! any further problems, consider saying hello on the [Bevy Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy)!
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! This short guide should help you get started with Avian.
//!
//! ## Add the Dependency
//!
//! First, add `avian2d` or `avian3d` to the dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!  
//! ```toml
//! # For 2D applications:
//! [dependencies]
//! avian2d = "0.4"
//!
//! # For 3D applications:
//! [dependencies]
//! avian3d = "0.4"
//!
//! # If you want to use the most up-to-date version, you can follow the main branch:
//! [dependencies]
//! avian3d = { git = "https://github.com/avianphysics/avian", branch = "main" }
//! ```
//!
//! You can specify features by disabling the default features and manually adding
//! the feature flags you want:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! # Add 3D Avian with double-precision floating point numbers.
//! # `parry-f64` enables collision detection using Parry.
//! avian3d = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["3d", "f64", "parry-f64", "xpbd_joints"] }
//! ```
//!

//!
//! ## Add the Plugins
//!
//! Avian is designed to be very modular. It is built from several [plugins](PhysicsPlugins) that
//! manage different parts of the engine. These plugins can be easily initialized and configured through
//! the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group.
//!
//! ```no_run
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     App::new()
//!         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::default()))
//!         // ...your other plugins, systems and resources
//!         .run();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now you can use all of Avian's components and resources to build whatever you want!
//!
//! For example, adding a [rigid body](RigidBody) with a [collider](Collider) is as simple as spawning an entity
//! with the [`RigidBody`] and [`Collider`] components:
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::circle(0.5)));"
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::sphere(0.5)));"
)]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can find lots of [usage examples](https://github.com/avianphysics/avian#more-examples)
//! in the project's [repository](https://github.com/avianphysics/avian).

//!
//! ## How does Avian compare to Rapier and bevy_rapier?
//!
//! Rapier is the biggest and most used physics engine in the Rust ecosystem, and it is currently
//! the most mature and feature-rich option.
//!
//! `bevy_rapier` is a great physics integration for Bevy, but it does have several problems:
//!
//! - It has to maintain a separate physics world and synchronize a ton of data with Bevy each frame
//! - The source code is difficult to inspect, as the vast majority of it is glue code and wrappers
//! for Bevy
//! - It has poor docs.rs documentation, and the documentation on rapier.rs is often outdated and
//! missing features
//! - Overall, it doesn't have a native ECS-like feel
//!
//! Avian on the other hand is built *for* Bevy *with* Bevy, and it uses the ECS for both the internals
//! and the public API. This removes the need for a separate physics world, reduces overhead, and makes
//! the source code much more approachable and easy to inspect for Bevy users.
//!
//! In part thanks to Bevy's modular architecture and the ECS, Avian is also highly composable,
//! as it consists of several independent plugins and provides lots of options for configuration and extensions,
//! from [custom schedules](PhysicsPlugins#custom-schedule) and [plugins](PhysicsPlugins#custom-plugins) to
//! [custom joints](dynamics::joints#custom-joints) and [constraints](dynamics::solver::xpbd#custom-constraints).
//!
//! One disadvantage of Avian is that it is still relatively young, so it can have more bugs,
//! some missing features, and fewer community resources and third party crates. However, it is growing quite
//! rapidly, and it is already pretty close to feature-parity with Rapier.
//!
//! At the end of the day, both engines are solid options. If you are looking for a more mature and tested
//! physics integration, `bevy_rapier` is the better choice, but if you prefer an engine with less overhead
//! and a more native Bevy integration, consider using Avian. Their core APIs are also quite similar,
//! so switching between them shouldn't be too difficult.
//!
//! ## Why is nothing happening?
//!
//! Make sure you have added the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group and you have given your rigid bodies
//! a [`RigidBody`] component. See the [getting started](#getting-started) section.
//!
//! ## Why is everything moving so slowly?
//!
//! If your application is in 2D, you might be using pixels as length units. This will require you to use
//! larger velocities and forces than you would in 3D. Make sure you set [`Gravity`] to some larger value
//! as well, because its magnitude is `9.81` by default, which is tiny in pixels.
//!
//! ## Why is performance so bad?
//!
//! It is highly recommended to enable some optimizations for debug builds, or to run your project
//! in release mode. This can have over a 100x performance impact in some cases.
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml` to enable optimizations for debug builds:
//!
//! ```toml
//! # Enable a small amount of optimization in the dev profile.
//! [profile.dev]
//! opt-level = 1
//!
//! # Enable a large amount of optimization in the dev profile for dependencies.
//! [profile.dev.package."*"]
//! opt-level = 3
//! ```
//!
//! You can also further optimize release builds by setting the number of codegen units to `1`,
//! although this will also increase build times.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [profile.release]
//! codegen-units = 1
//! ```
//!
//! If you still have performance issues, consider enabling the [`PhysicsDiagnosticsPlugin`]
//! and [`PhysicsDiagnosticsUiPlugin`] (requires the `diagnostic_ui` feature) to see where time is being spent.
//! See the [diagnostics](diagnostics) module for more information.
//!
//! ## Why does movement look choppy?
//!
//! To produce consistent, frame rate independent behavior, physics by default runs
//! in the [`FixedPostUpdate`] schedule with a fixed timestep, meaning that the time between
//! physics ticks remains constant. On some frames, physics can either not run at all or run
//! more than once to catch up to real time. This can lead to visible stutter for movement.
//!
//! This stutter can be resolved by *interpolating* or *extrapolating* the positions of physics objects
//! in between physics ticks. Avian has built-in support for this through the [`PhysicsInterpolationPlugin`],
//! which is included in the [`PhysicsPlugins`] by default.
//!
//! Interpolation can be enabled for an individual entity by adding the [`TransformInterpolation`] component:
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//!     // Enable interpolation for this rigid body.
//!     commands.spawn((
//!         RigidBody::Dynamic,
//!         Transform::default(),
//!         TransformInterpolation,
//!     ));
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! To make *all* rigid bodies interpolated by default, use [`PhysicsInterpolationPlugin::interpolate_all()`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! fn main() {
//!    App::new()
//!       .add_plugins(PhysicsPlugins::default().set(PhysicsInterpolationPlugin::interpolate_all()))
//!       // ...
//!       .run();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See the [`PhysicsInterpolationPlugin`] for more information.
//!
//! If this does not fix the choppiness, the problem could also be related to system ordering.
//! If you have a system for camera following, make sure it runs *after* physics,
//! but *before* Bevy's transform propagation in `PostUpdate`.
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! #
//! # let mut app = App::new();
//! #
//! app.add_systems(
//!     PostUpdate,
//!     camera_follow_player.before(TransformSystems::Propagate),
//! );
//! #
//! # fn camera_follow_player() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Is there a character controller?
//!
//! Avian does not have a built-in character controller yet, so if you need one,
//! you will need to implement it yourself. However, third party character controllers
//! like [`bevy_tnua`](https://github.com/idanarye/bevy-tnua) support Avian, and [`bevy_mod_wanderlust`](https://github.com/PROMETHIA-27/bevy_mod_wanderlust)
//! and others are also likely to get Avian support soon.
//!
//! For custom character controllers, you can take a look at the
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_2d`] and [`kinematic_character_2d`] examples to get started."
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_3d`] and [`kinematic_character_3d`] examples to get started."
)]
//!
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_2d`]: https://github.com/avianphysics/avian/tree/main/crates/avian2d/examples/dynamic_character_2d
[`kinematic_character_2d`]: https://github.com/avianphysics/avian/tree/main/crates/avian2d/examples/kinematic_character_2d"

[`kinematic_character_3d`]: https://github.com/avianphysics/avian/tree/main/crates/avian3d/examples/kinematic_character_3d"
)]
//!
//! ## Why are there separate `Position` and `Rotation` components?
//!
//! While `Transform` can be used for the vast majority of things, Avian internally
//! uses separate [`Position`] and [`Rotation`] components. These are automatically
//! kept in sync by the [`PhysicsTransformPlugin`].
//!
//! There are several reasons why the separate components are currently used.
//!
//! - Position and rotation should be global from the physics engine's point of view.
//! - Transform scale and shearing can cause issues and rounding errors in physics.
//! - Transform hierarchies can be problematic.
//! - There is no `f64` version of `Transform`.
//! - There is no 2D version of `Transform` (yet), and having a 2D version can optimize several computations.
//! - When position and rotation are separate, we can technically have more systems running in parallel.
//! - Only rigid bodies have rotation, particles typically don't (although we don't make a distinction yet).
//!
//! In external projects however, using [`Position`] and [`Rotation`] is only necessary when you
//! need to manage positions within [`PhysicsSystems::StepSimulation`]. Elsewhere, you should be able to use `Transform`.
//!
//! There is also a possibility that we will revisit this if/when Bevy has a `Transform2d` component.
//! Using `Transform` feels more idiomatic and simple, so it would be nice if it could be used directly
//! as long as we can get around the drawbacks.
//!
//! ## Can the engine be used on servers?
//!
//! Yes! Networking often requires running the simulation in a specific schedule, and in Avian it is straightforward
//! to [set the schedule that runs physics](PhysicsPlugins#custom-schedule) and [configure the timestep](Physics) if needed.
//! By default, physics runs at a fixed timestep in [`FixedPostUpdate`].
//!
//! ## Something else?
//!
//! Physics engines are very large and Avian is still young, so stability issues and bugs are to be expected.
//!
//! If you encounter issues, please consider first taking a look at the
//! [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/avianphysics/avian/issues) and
//! [open a new issue](https://github.com/avianphysics/avian/issues/new) if there already isn't one regarding your problem.

/// of around 100 pixels. By setting the length unit to `100.0`, the physics engine
/// will interpret 100 pixels as 1 meter for internal thresholds, improving stability.
///
/// The length unit can be set by inserting the resource like normal,
/// but it can also be specified through the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// use avian2d::prelude::*;
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
///

/// # Custom Schedule
///
/// You can run the [`PhysicsSchedule`] in any schedule you want by specifying the schedule when adding the plugin group:

///
/// First, create a new plugin. If you want to run your systems in the engine's schedules, get either the [`PhysicsSchedule`]
