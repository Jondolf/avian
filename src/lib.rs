//! # ![Avian Physics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jondolf/avian/avian/assets/branding/logo.svg)
//!
//! **Avian** is an ECS-driven 2D and 3D physics engine for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).
//!
//! Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian)
//! for more information about the design, read the [Getting started](#getting-started)
//! guide below to get up to speed, and take a look at the [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
//! for an overview of the engine's features and their documentation.
//!
//! You can also check out the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions), and if you encounter
//! any further problems, consider saying hello on the [Bevy Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy)!
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! This short guide should help you get started with Avian.
//!
//! ### Add the dependency
//!
//! First, add `avian2d` or `avian3d` to the dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!  
//! ```toml
//! # For 2D applications:
//! [dependencies]
//! avian2d = "0.1"
//!
//! # For 3D applications:
//! [dependencies]
//! avian3d = "0.1"
//!
//! # If you want to use the most up-to-date version, you can follow the main branch:
//! [dependencies]
//! avian3d = { git = "https://github.com/Jondolf/avian", branch = "main" }
//! ```
//!
//! You can specify features by disabling the default features and manually adding
//! the feature flags you want:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! # Add 3D Avian with double-precision floating point numbers.
//! # `parry-f64` enables collision detection using Parry.
//! avian3d = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["3d", "f64", "parry-f64"] }
//! ```
//!

//!
//! ### Add the plugins
//!
//! Avian is designed to be very modular. It is built from several [plugins](PhysicsPlugins) that
//! manage different parts of the engine. These plugins can be easily initialized and configured through
//! the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group.
//!
//! ```no_run
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     App::new()
//!         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::default()))
//!         // ...your other plugins, systems and resources
//!         .run();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now you can use all of Avian's components and resources to build whatever you want!
//!
//! For example, adding a [rigid body](RigidBody) with a [collider](Collider) is as simple as spawning an entity
//! with the [`RigidBody`] and [`Collider`] components:
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::circle(0.5)));"
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::sphere(0.5)));"
)]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can find lots of [usage examples](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian#more-examples)
//! in the project's [repository](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian).

//!
//! ### How does Avian compare to Rapier and bevy_rapier?
//!
//! Rapier is the biggest and most used physics engine in the Rust ecosystem, and it is currently
//! the most mature and feature-rich option.
//!
//! `bevy_rapier` is a great physics integration for Bevy, but it does have several problems:
//!
//! - It has to maintain a separate physics world and synchronize a ton of data with Bevy each frame
//! - The source code is difficult to inspect, as the vast majority of it is glue code and wrappers
//! for Bevy
//! - It has poor docs.rs documentation, and the documentation on rapier.rs is often outdated and
//! missing features
//! - It is hard to extend as it's not very modular or composable in design
//! - Overall, it doesn't have a native ECS-like feel outside of its public API
//!
//! Avian on the other hand is built *for* Bevy *with* Bevy, and it uses the ECS for both the internals
//! and the public API. This removes the need for a separate physics world, reduces overhead, and makes
//! the source code much more approachable and easy to inspect for Bevy users.
//!
//! In part thanks to Bevy's modular architecture and the ECS, Avian is also highly composable,
//! as it consists of several independent plugins and provides lots of options for configuration and extensions,
//! from [custom schedules](PhysicsPlugins#custom-schedule) and [plugins](PhysicsPlugins#custom-plugins) to
//! [custom joints](dynamics::solver::joints#custom-joints) and [constraints](dynamics::solver::xpbd#custom-constraints).
//!
//! One disadvantage of Avian is that it is still relatively young, so it can have more bugs,
//! some missing features, and fewer community resources and third party crates. However, it is growing quite
//! rapidly, and it is already pretty close to feature-parity with Rapier.
//!
//! At the end of the day, both engines are solid options. If you are looking for a more mature and tested
//! physics integration, `bevy_rapier` is the better choice, but if you prefer an engine with less overhead
//! and a more native Bevy integration, consider using Avian. Their core APIs are also quite similar,
//! so switching between them shouldn't be too difficult.
//!
//! ### Why is nothing happening?
//!
//! Make sure you have added the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group and you have given your rigid bodies
//! a [`RigidBody`] component. See the [getting started](#getting-started) section.
//!
//! ### Why is everything moving so slowly?
//!
//! If your application is in 2D, you might be using pixels as length units. This will require you to use
//! larger velocities and forces than you would in 3D. Make sure you set [`Gravity`] to some larger value
//! as well, because its magnitude is `9.81` by default, which is tiny in pixels.
//!
//! ### Why did my rigid body suddenly vanish?
//!
//! Make sure to [give your rigid bodies some mass](RigidBody#adding-mass-properties), either by adding a [`Collider`]
//! or a [`MassPropertiesBundle`]. If your bodies don't have any mass, any physical interaction is likely to
//! instantly give them infinite velocity.
//!
//! Avian should automatically print warnings when it detects bodies with an invalid mass or inertia.
//!
//! ### Why is performance so bad?
//!
//! Make sure you are building your project in release mode using `cargo build --release`.
//!
//! You can further optimize builds by setting the number of codegen units in your `Cargo.toml` to 1,
//! although this will also increase build times.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [profile.release]
//! codegen-units = 1
//! ```
//!
//! ### Why does my camera following jitter?
//!
//! When you write a system that makes the camera follow a physics entity, you might notice some jitter.
//!
//! To fix this, the system needs to:
//!
//! - Run after physics so that it has the up-to-date position of the player.
//! - Run before transform propagation so that your changes to the camera's `Transform` are written
//! to the camera's `GlobalTransform` before the end of the frame.
//!
//! The following ordering constraints should resolve the issue.
//!
//! ```
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy::transform::TransformSystem;
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! #     let mut app = App::new();
//! #
//! app.add_systems(
//!     PostUpdate,
//!     camera_follow_player
//!         .after(PhysicsSet::Sync)
//!         .before(TransformSystem::TransformPropagate),
//! );
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn camera_follow_player() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Is there a character controller?
//!
//! Avian does not have a built-in character controller, so if you need one,
//! you will need to implement it yourself. However, third party character controllers
//! like [`bevy_tnua`](https://github.com/idanarye/bevy-tnua) support Avian, and [`bevy_mod_wanderlust`](https://github.com/PROMETHIA-27/bevy_mod_wanderlust)
//! and others are also likely to get Avian support soon.
//!
//! For custom character controllers, you can take a look at the
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_2d`] and [`kinematic_character_2d`] examples to get started."
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_3d`] and [`kinematic_character_3d`] examples to get started."
)]
//!
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_2d`]: https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/tree/main/crates/avian2d/examples/dynamic_character_2d
[`kinematic_character_2d`]: https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/tree/main/crates/avian2d/examples/kinematic_character_2d"
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_3d`]: https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/tree/main/crates/avian3d/examples/dynamic_character_3d
[`kinematic_character_3d`]: https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/tree/main/crates/avian3d/examples/kinematic_character_3d"
)]
//!
//! ### Why are there separate `Position` and `Rotation` components?
//!
//! While `Transform` can be used for the vast majority of things, Avian internally
//! uses separate [`Position`] and [`Rotation`] components. These are automatically
//! kept in sync by the [`SyncPlugin`].
//!
//! There are several reasons why the separate components are currently used.
//!
//! - Position and rotation should be global from the physics engine's point of view.
//! - Transform scale and shearing can cause issues and rounding errors in physics.
//! - Transform hierarchies can be problematic.
//! - There is no `f64` version of `Transform`.
//! - There is no 2D version of `Transform` (yet), and having a 2D version can optimize several computations.
//! - When position and rotation are separate, we can technically have more systems running in parallel.
//! - Only rigid bodies have rotation, particles typically don't (although we don't make a distinction yet).
//!
//! In external projects however, using [`Position`] and [`Rotation`] is only necessary when you
//! need to manage positions within [`PhysicsSet::StepSimulation`]. Elsewhere, you should be able to use `Transform`.
//!
//! There is also a possibility that we will revisit this if/when Bevy has a `Transform2d` component.
//! Using `Transform` feels more idiomatic and simple, so it would be nice if it could be used directly
//! as long as we can get around the drawbacks.
//!
//! ### Can the engine be used on servers?
//!
//! Yes! Networking often requires running the simulation in a specific schedule, and in Avian you can
//! [set the schedule that runs physics](PhysicsPlugins#custom-schedule) and [configure the timestep](Physics)
//! to whatever you want.
//!
//! One configuration is to run the client in `FixedUpdate`, and to use a fixed timestep for [`Time<Physics>`](Physics)
//! on both the server and the client to make sure the physics simulation is only advanced by one step
//! each time the schedule runs.
//!
//! Note that while Avian should be locally deterministic (at least when single-threaded),
//! it can produce slightly different results on different machines.
//!
//! ### Something else?
//!
//! Physics engines are very large and Avian is young, so stability issues and bugs are to be expected.
//!
//! If you encounter issues, please consider first taking a look at the
//! [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/issues) and
//! [open a new issue](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian/issues/new) if there already isn't one regarding your problem.
//!
//! You can also come and say hello on the [Bevy Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gMUk5Ph).
//! There you can find a avian thread on the crate-help channel where you can ask questions.

///
/// ## World scale
///
/// The [`PhysicsLengthUnit`] resource is a units-per-meter scaling factor
/// that adjusts the engine's internal properties to the scale of the world.
/// It is recommended to configure the length unit to match the approximate length
/// of the average dynamic object in the world to get the best simulation results.
///
/// For example, a 2D game might use pixels as units and have an average object size
/// of around 100 pixels. By setting the length unit to `100.0`, the physics engine
/// will interpret 100 pixels as 1 meter for internal thresholds, improving stability.
///
/// The length unit can be set by inserting the resource like normal,
/// but it can also be specified through the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// use avian2d::prelude::*;
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
///
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// fn main() {
///     App::new()
///         .add_plugins((
///             DefaultPlugins,
///             // A 2D game with 100 pixels per meter
///             PhysicsPlugins::default().with_length_unit(100.0),
///         ))
///         .run();
/// }
/// # #[cfg(not(feature = "2d"))]
/// # fn main() {} // Doc test needs main
/// ```
///
/// ## Custom schedule
///
/// You can run the [`PhysicsSchedule`] in any schedule you want by specifying the schedule when adding the plugin group:
///
/// ```no_run
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
///
/// fn main() {
///     App::new()
///         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::new(FixedUpdate)))
///         .run();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Note that using `FixedUpdate` with a fixed [physics timestep](Physics) can produce unexpected results due to two separate
/// fixed timesteps. However, using `FixedUpdate` can be useful for [networking usage](crate#can-the-engine-be-used-on-servers)
/// when you need to keep the client and server in sync.
///
/// ## Custom plugins
///
/// First, create a new plugin. If you want to run your systems in the engine's schedules, get either the [`PhysicsSchedule`]
/// or the [`SubstepSchedule`]. Then you can add your systems to that schedule and control system ordering with system sets like
/// [`PhysicsStepSet`], [`SolverSet`], or [`SubstepSolverSet`](dynamics::solver::SubstepSolverSet).
///
/// Here we will create a custom broad phase plugin that will replace the default [`BroadPhasePlugin`]:
///
/// ```
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
///
/// pub struct CustomBroadPhasePlugin;
///
/// impl Plugin for CustomBroadPhasePlugin {
///     fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {
///         // Make sure the PhysicsSchedule is available
///         let physics_schedule = app
///             .get_schedule_mut(PhysicsSchedule)
///             .expect("add PhysicsSchedule first");
///
///         // Add the system into the broad phase system set
///         physics_schedule.add_systems(collect_collision_pairs.in_set(PhysicsStepSet::BroadPhase));
///     }
/// }
///
/// fn collect_collision_pairs() {
///     // Implementation goes here
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Next, when creating your app, simply disable the default [`BroadPhasePlugin`] and add your custom plugin:
///
/// ```no_run
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use avian2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use avian3d::prelude::*;")]
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
///
/// # struct CustomBroadPhasePlugin;
/// # impl Plugin for CustomBroadPhasePlugin {
/// #     fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {}
/// # }
/// #
/// fn main() {
///     let mut app = App::new();
///
///     app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);
///
///     // Add PhysicsPlugins and replace default broad phase with our custom broad phase
///     app.add_plugins(
///         PhysicsPlugins::default()
///             .build()
///             .disable::<BroadPhasePlugin>()
///             .add(CustomBroadPhasePlugin),
///     );
///
///     app.run();
