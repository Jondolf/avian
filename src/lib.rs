//! # Bevy XPBD
//!
//! **Bevy XPBD** is a 2D and 3D physics engine based on
//! [*Extended Position Based Dynamics* (XPBD)](#what-is-xpbd) for
//! the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).
//!
//! Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd)
//! for more information about the design, read the [Getting started](#getting-started)
//! guide below to get up to speed, and take a look at the [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
//! for an overview of the engine's features and their documentation.
//!
//! You can also check out the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions), and if you encounter
//! any further problems, consider saying hello on the [Bevy Discord](https://discord.gg/bevy)!
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! This short guide should help you get started with Bevy XPBD.
//!
//! ### Add the dependency
//!
//! First, add `bevy_xpbd_2d` or `bevy_xpbd_3d` to the dependencies in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!  
//! ```toml
//! # For 2D applications:
//! [dependencies]
//! bevy_xpbd_2d = "0.4"
//!
//! # For 3D applications:
//! [dependencies]
//! bevy_xpbd_3d = "0.4"
//!
//! # If you want to use the most up-to-date version, you can follow the main branch:
//! [dependencies]
//! bevy_xpbd_3d = { git = "https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd", branch = "main" }
//! ```
//!
//! You can specify features by disabling the default features and manually adding
//! the feature flags you want:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! # Add 3D Bevy XPBD with double-precision floating point numbers.
//! # `parry-f64` enables collision detection using Parry.
//! bevy_xpbd_3d = { version = "0.4", default-features = false, features = ["3d", "f64", "parry-f64"] }
//! ```
//!

//!
//! ### Install the plugin
//!
//! Bevy XPBD is designed to be very modular. It is built from several [plugins] that
//! manage different parts of the engine. These plugins can be easily initialized and configured through
//! the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     App::new()
//!         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::default()))
//!         // ...your other plugins, systems and resources
//!         .run();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Now you can use all of Bevy XPBD's [components] and [resources] to build whatever you want!
//!
//! For example, adding a [rigid body](RigidBody) with a [collider](Collider) is as simple as spawning an entity
//! with the [`RigidBody`] and [`Collider`] components:
//!
//! ```
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
//!
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::circle(0.5)));"
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::sphere(0.5)));"
)]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can find lots of [usage examples](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd#more-examples)
//! in the project's [repository](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd).

//!
//! ### How does Bevy XPBD compare to Rapier and bevy_rapier?
//!
//! Rapier is the biggest and most used physics engine in the Rust ecosystem, and it is currently
//! the most mature and feature-rich option.
//!
//! `bevy_rapier` is a great physics integration for Bevy, but it does have several problems:
//!
//! - It has to maintain a separate physics world and synchronize a ton of data with Bevy each frame
//! - The source code is difficult to inspect, as the vast majority of it is glue code and wrappers
//! for Bevy
//! - It has poor docs.rs documentation, and the documentation on rapier.rs is often outdated and
//! missing features
//! - It is hard to extend as it's not very modular or composable in design
//! - Overall, it doesn't have a native ECS-like feel outside of its public API
//!
//! Bevy XPBD on the other hand is built *for* Bevy *with* Bevy, and it uses the ECS for both the internals
//! and the public API. This removes the need for a separate physics world, reduces overhead, and makes
//! the source code much more approachable and easy to inspect for Bevy users.
//!
//! In part thanks to Bevy's modular architecture and the ECS, Bevy XPBD is also highly composable,
//! as it consists of several independent plugins and provides lots of options for configuration and extensions,
//! from [custom schedules](PhysicsPlugins#custom-schedule) and [plugins](PhysicsPlugins#custom-plugins) to
//! [custom joints](joints#custom-joints) and [constraints](constraints#custom-constraints).
//!
//! In terms of the physics implementation, Rapier uses an impulse/velocity based solver, while Bevy XPBD uses
//! [Extended Position Based Dynamics](#what-is-xpbd). On paper, XPBD should be more stable and robust,
//! but it hasn't been widely adopted in mainstream usage yet.
//!
//! One of the biggest disadvantages of Bevy XPBD is that it is still very young, so it can have lots of bugs,
//! some missing features, and fewer community resources and third party crates. However, it is growing quite
//! rapidly, and it is already pretty close to feature-parity with Rapier.
//!
//! At the end of the day, both engines are very solid options. If you are looking for a more mature and tested
//! physics integration, `bevy_rapier` is the better choice, but if you prefer an engine with less overhead
//! and a more native Bevy integration, consider using Bevy XPBD. Their core APIs are also quite similar,
//! so switching between them should be straightforward.
//!
//! ### Why is nothing happening?
//!
//! Make sure you have added the [`PhysicsPlugins`] plugin group and you have given your rigid bodies
//! a [`RigidBody`] component. See the [getting started](#getting-started) section.
//!
//! ### Why is everything moving so slowly?
//!
//! If your application is in 2D, you might be using pixels as length units. This will require you to use
//! larger velocities and forces than you would in 3D. Make sure you set [`Gravity`] to some larger value
//! as well, because its magnitude is 9.81 by default, which is tiny in pixels.
//!
//! Bevy XPBD doesn't have a "physics scale" yet, but it will most likely be added in the future
//! so that it's possible to define some kind of pixels per meter configuration.
//!
//! ### Why did my rigid body suddenly vanish?
//!
//! Make sure to [give your rigid bodies some mass](RigidBody#adding-mass-properties), either by adding a [`Collider`]
//! or a [`MassPropertiesBundle`]. If your bodies don't have any mass, any physical interaction is likely to
//! instantly give them infinite velocity.
//!
//! Bevy XPBD should automatically print warnings when it detects bodies with an invalid mass or inertia.
//!
//! ### Why is performance so bad?
//!
//! Make sure you are building your project in release mode using `cargo build --release`.
//!
//! You can further optimize builds by setting the number of codegen units in your `Cargo.toml` to 1,
//! although this will also increase build times.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [profile.release]
//! codegen-units = 1
//! ```
//!
//! Note that Bevy XPBD simply isn't very optimized yet, and it mostly runs on a single thread for now.
//! This will be addressed in future releases.
//!
//! ### Why does my camera following jitter?
//!
//! When you write a system that makes the camera follow a physics entity, you might notice some jitter.
//!
//! To fix this, the system needs to:
//!
//! - Run after physics so that it has the up-to-date position of the player.
//! - Run before transform propagation so that your changes to the camera's `Transform` are written
//! to the camera's `GlobalTransform` before the end of the frame.
//!
//! The following ordering constraints should resolve the issue.
//!
//! ```
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy::transform::TransformSystem;
#![cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#![cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
//! #
//! # fn main() {
//! #     let mut app = App::new();
//! #
//! app.add_systems(
//!     PostUpdate,
//!     camera_follow_player
//!         .after(PhysicsSet::Sync)
//!         .before(TransformSystem::TransformPropagate),
//! );
//! # }
//! #
//! # fn camera_follow_player() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Is there a character controller?
//!
//! Bevy XPBD does not have a built-in character controller, so if you need one,
//! you will need to implement it yourself. However, third party character controllers
//! like [`bevy_tnua`](https://github.com/idanarye/bevy-tnua) support Bevy XPBD, and [`bevy_mod_wanderlust`](https://github.com/PROMETHIA-27/bevy_mod_wanderlust)
//! and others are also likely to get Bevy XPBD support soon.
//!
//! For custom character controllers, you can take a look at the
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_2d`] and [`kinematic_character_2d`] examples to get started."
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "[`dynamic_character_3d`] and [`kinematic_character_3d`] examples to get started."
)]

[`kinematic_character_3d`]: https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/tree/main/crates/bevy_xpbd_3d/examples/kinematic_character_3d"
)]
//!
//! ### Why are there separate `Position` and `Rotation` components?
//!
//! While `Transform` can be used for the vast majority of things, Bevy XPBD internally
//! uses separate [`Position`] and [`Rotation`] components. These are automatically
//! kept in sync by the [`SyncPlugin`].
//!
//! There are several reasons why the separate components are currently used.
//!
//! - Position and rotation should be global from the physics engine's point of view.
//! - Transform scale and shearing can cause issues and rounding errors in physics.
//! - Transform hierarchies can be problematic.
//! - There is no `f64` version of `Transform`.
//! - There is no 2D version of `Transform` (yet), and having a 2D version can optimize several computations.
//! - When position and rotation are separate, we can technically have more systems running in parallel.
//! - Only rigid bodies have rotation, particles typically don't (although we don't make a distinction yet).
//!
//! In external projects however, using [`Position`] and [`Rotation`] is only necessary when you
//! need to manage positions in the [`SubstepSchedule`]. Elsewhere, you should be able to use `Transform`.
//!
//! There is also a possibility that we will revisit this if/when Bevy has a `Transform2d` component.
//! Using `Transform` feels more idiomatic and simple, so it would be nice if it could be used directly
//! as long as we can get around the drawbacks.
//!
//! ### Can the engine be used on servers?
//!
//! Yes! Networking often requires running the simulation in a specific schedule, and in Bevy XPBD you can
//! [set the schedule that runs physics](PhysicsPlugins#custom-schedule) and [configure the timestep](Physics)
//! to whatever you want.
//!
//! One configuration is to run the client in `FixedUpdate`, and to use a fixed timestep for [`Time<Physics>`](Physics)
//! on both the server and the client to make sure the physics simulation is only advanced by one step
//! each time the schedule runs.
//!
//! Note that while Bevy XPBD should be locally deterministic, it can produce slightly different results on different
//! machines.
//!
//! ### Something else?
//!
//! Physics engines are very large and Bevy XPBD is young, so stability issues and bugs are to be expected.
//!
//! If you encounter issues, please consider first taking a look at the
//! [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/issues) and
//! [open a new issue](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/issues/new) if there already isn't one regarding your problem.
//!
//! You can also come and say hello on the [Bevy Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gMUk5Ph).
//! There you can find a bevy_xpbd thread on the crate-help channel where you can ask questions.
//!
//! ## What is XPBD?
//!
//! *XPBD* or *Extended Position Based Dynamics* is a physics simulation method that extends
//! the traditional *PBD* to be more physically accurate and less dependent on time step size
//! and iteration count.
//!
//! Unlike force or impulse based physics simulation methods, XPBD mostly operates at the position-level,
//! which can produce more stable and reliable results, while allowing straightforward coupling
//! of [rigid bodies](RigidBody), soft bodies and fluids.
//!
//! ### Simulation loop
//!
//! At a high level, XPBD consists of a broad phase followed by a substepping loop that handles position
//! [integration](integrator), [constraint solving](solver), velocity updates, and a velocity solver that
//! handles dynamic friction and restitution.
//!
//! It looks roughly like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! while simulating:
//!     // Substep size
//!     h = ∆t / substep_count
//!
//!     // Broad phase
//!     broad_collision_pairs = collect_collision_pairs()
//!
//!     for substep_count:
//!         // Integrate
//!         for n particles and bodies:
//!             // Integrate position
//!             x_prev = x
//!             v = v + h * f_ext / m
//!             x = x + h * v
//!
//!             // Integrate rotation
//!             q_prev = q
//!             ω = ω + h * I^-1 * (τ_ext - (ω x (I * ω)))
//!             q = q + h * 0.5 * [ω_x, ω_y, ω_z, 0] * q
//!             q = q / |q|
//!
//!         // Narrow phase
//!         for pair in broad_collision_pairs:

//! In Bevy XPBD, the simulation loop is handled by various plugins. The [`PhysicsSetupPlugin`] sets up
//! the Bevy schedules[^1][^2] and sets[^3][^4][^5], the [`BroadPhasePlugin`] manages the broad phase, the [`IntegratorPlugin`]
//! handles XPBD integration, and so on. You can find all of the plugins and their responsibilities [here](PhysicsPlugins).

//!
//! ### Learning resources
//!
//! If you want to learn more about XPBD, I recommend taking a look at some of the papers.
//! Especially the first one from 2020 was used heavily for the simulation loop and constraints in Bevy XPBD.
//!
//! - XPBD: Müller M, Macklin M, Chentanez N, Jeschke S, Kim T. 2020. *[Detailed Rigid Body Simulation with Extended Position Based Dynamics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/PBDBodies.pdf)*.
//! - XPBD: Macklin M, Müller M, Chentanez N. 2016. *[XPBD: Position-Based Simulation of Compliant Constrained Dynamics](http://mmacklin.com/xpbd.pdf)*.
//!
//! The papers are quite academic, so you might instead prefer some videos and articles.
//! The first one by Ten Minute Physics (Matthias Müller, one of the XPBD researchers) is great for understanding
//! how XPBD differs from other simulation methods and how the constraints work.
