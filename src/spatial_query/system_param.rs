/// - [Raycasting](spatial_query#raycasting): [`cast_ray`](SpatialQuery::cast_ray),
///   [`ray_hits`](SpatialQuery::ray_hits), [`ray_hits_callback`](SpatialQuery::ray_hits_callback)
/// - [Shapecasting](spatial_query#shapecasting): [`cast_shape`](SpatialQuery::cast_shape),
///   [`shape_hits`](SpatialQuery::shape_hits), [`shape_hits_callback`](SpatialQuery::shape_hits_callback)
/// - [Point projection](spatial_query#point-projection): [`project_point`](SpatialQuery::project_point)
/// - [Intersection tests](spatial_query#intersection-tests)
///     - Point intersections: [`point_intersections`](SpatialQuery::point_intersections),
///       [`point_intersections_callback`](SpatialQuery::point_intersections_callback)
///     - AABB intersections: [`aabb_intersections_with_aabb`](SpatialQuery::aabb_intersections_with_aabb),
///       [`aabb_intersections_with_aabb_callback`](SpatialQuery::aabb_intersections_with_aabb_callback)
///     - Shape intersections: [`shape_intersections`](SpatialQuery::shape_intersections)
///       [`shape_intersections_callback`](SpatialQuery::shape_intersections_callback)
///
/// For simple raycasts and shapecasts, consider using the [`RayCaster`] and [`ShapeCaster`] components that
