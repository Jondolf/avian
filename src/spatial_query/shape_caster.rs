/// A component used for [shapecasting](spatial_query#shapecasting).
///
/// **Shapecasting** is a type of [spatial query](spatial_query) where a shape travels along a straight
/// line and computes hits with colliders. This is often used to determine how far an object can move
/// in a direction before it hits something.
///
/// Each shapecast is defined by a `shape` (a [`Collider`]), its local `shape_rotation`, a local `origin` and
/// a local `direction`. The [`ShapeCaster`] will find each hit and add them to the [`ShapeHits`] component in
/// the order of distance.
///
/// Computing lots of hits can be expensive, especially against complex geometry, so the maximum number of hits
/// is one by default. This can be configured through the `max_hits` property.
///
/// The [`ShapeCaster`] is the easiest way to handle simple shapecasting. If you want more control and don't want
/// to perform shapecasts on every frame, consider using the [`SpatialQuery`] system parameter.
///
