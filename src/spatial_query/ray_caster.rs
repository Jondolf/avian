/// A component used for [raycasting](spatial_query#raycasting).
///
/// **Raycasting** is a type of [spatial query](spatial_query) that finds one or more hits
/// between a ray and a set of colliders.
///
/// Each ray is defined by a local `origin` and a `direction`. The [`RayCaster`] will find each hit
/// and add them to the [`RayHits`] component. Each hit has a `time_of_impact` property
/// which refers to how long the ray travelled, i.e. the distance between the `origin` and the point of intersection.
///
/// The [`RayCaster`] is the easiest way to handle simple raycasts. If you want more control and don't want to
/// perform raycasts every frame, consider using the [`SpatialQuery`] system parameter.
///
/// ## Hit count and order
///
/// The results of a raycast are in an arbitrary order by default. You can iterate over them in the order of
/// time of impact with the [`RayHits::iter_sorted`] method.
///
/// You can configure the maximum amount of hits for a ray using `max_hits`. By default this is unbounded,
/// so you will get all hits. When the number or complexity of colliders is large, this can be very
/// expensive computationally. Set the value to whatever works best for your case.
///
/// Note that when there are more hits than `max_hits`, **some hits will be missed**.
/// To guarantee that the closest hit is included, you should set `max_hits` to one or a value that
/// is enough to contain all hits.
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use avian2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// use avian3d::prelude::*;
/// use bevy::prelude::*;

///         for hit in hits.iter_sorted() {
