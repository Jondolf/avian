/// A collider used for detecting collisions and generating contacts.
///
/// ## Creation
///
/// `Collider` has tons of methods for creating colliders of various shapes:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
/// // Create a ball collider with a given radius
/// commands.spawn(Collider::ball(0.5));
/// // Create a capsule collider with a given height and radius
/// commands.spawn(Collider::capsule(2.0, 0.5));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Colliders on their own only detect contacts and generate [collision events](#collision-events).
/// To make colliders apply contact forces, they have to be attached to [rigid bodies](RigidBody):
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
/// #
/// // Spawn a dynamic body that falls onto a static platform
/// fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
///     commands.spawn((
///         RigidBody::Dynamic,
///         Collider::ball(0.5),
///         Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 2.0, 0.0),
///     ));
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "2d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Static, Collider::cuboid(5.0, 0.5)));"
)]
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "3d",
    doc = "    commands.spawn((RigidBody::Static, Collider::cuboid(5.0, 0.5, 5.0)));"
)]
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Colliders can be further configured using various components like [`Friction`], [`Restitution`],
/// [`Sensor`], and [`CollisionLayers`].
///
/// In addition, Bevy XPBD automatically adds some other components for colliders, like the following:
///
/// - [`ColliderAabb`]
/// - [`CollidingEntities`]
/// - [`ColliderMassProperties`]
///
/// ## Multiple colliders
///
/// It can often be useful to attach multiple colliders to the same rigid body.
///
/// This can be done in two ways. Either use [`Collider::compound`] to have one collider that consists of many
/// shapes, or for more control, spawn several collider entities as the children of a rigid body:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
/// #
/// fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
///     // Spawn a rigid body with one collider on the same entity and two as children
///     commands
///         .spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::ball(0.5)))
///         .with_children(|children| {
///             // Spawn the child colliders positioned relative to the rigid body
///             children.spawn((Collider::ball(0.5), Transform::from_xyz(2.0, 0.0, 0.0)));
///             children.spawn((Collider::ball(0.5), Transform::from_xyz(-2.0, 0.0, 0.0)));
///         });
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Colliders can be arbitrarily nested and transformed relative to the parent.
/// The rigid body that a collider is attached to can be accessed using the [`ColliderParent`] component.
///
/// The benefit of using separate entities for the colliders is that each collider can have its own
/// [friction](Friction), [restitution](Restitution), [collision layers](CollisionLayers),
/// and other configuration options, and they send separate [collision events](#collision-events).
///
/// ## Sensors
///
/// If you want a collider to be attached to a rigid body but don't want it to apply forces on
/// contact, you can add a [`Sensor`] component to make the collider only send
/// [collision events](#collision-events):
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
/// #
/// # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
/// // This body will pass through objects but still generate collision events
/// commands.spawn((
///     RigidBody::Dynamic,
///     Collider::ball(0.5),
///     Sensor,
/// ));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Collision layers
///
/// Collision layers can be used to configure which entities can collide with each other.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
/// #
/// #[derive(PhysicsLayer)]
/// enum Layer {
///     Player,
///     Enemy,
///     Ground,
/// }
///
/// fn spawn(mut commands: Commands) {
///     commands.spawn((
///         Collider::ball(0.5),
///         // Player collides with enemies and the ground, but not with other players
///         CollisionLayers::new([Layer::Player], [Layer::Enemy, Layer::Ground])
///     ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See [`CollisionLayers`] for more information and examples.
///
/// ## Collision events
///
/// There are currently three different collision events: [`Collision`], [`CollisionStarted`] and [`CollisionEnded`].
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
/// #
/// fn my_system(mut collision_event_reader: EventReader<Collision>) {
///     for Collision(contact_pair) in collision_event_reader.iter() {
///         println!(
///             "{:?} and {:?} are colliding",
///             contact_pair.entity1, contact_pair.entity2
///         );
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The entities that are colliding with a given entity can also be accessed using
/// the [`CollidingEntities`] component.
///
/// ## Querying and modifying contacts
///
/// The [`Collisions`] resource grants access to all collisions.
/// It can be used to get, modify, filter and add collisions.
///
/// See [`Collisions`] for more details.
///
/// ## Advanced usage
///
/// Internally, `Collider` uses the shapes provided by `parry`. If you want to create a collider
/// using these shapes, you can simply use `Collider::from(SharedShape::some_method())`.
///
/// To get a reference to the internal [`SharedShape`], you can use the [`get_shape`](#method.get_shape) method.
