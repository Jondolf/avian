/// A collider used for collision detection.
///
/// By default, colliders generate [collision events](#collision-events) and cause a collision response for
/// [rigid bodies](RigidBody). If you only want collision events, you can add a [`Sensor`] component.
///
/// ## Creation
///
/// `Collider` has tons of methods for creating colliders of various shapes.
/// For example, to add a ball collider to a [rigid body](RigidBody), use [`Collider::ball`](#method.ball):
///
/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
///
/// fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
///     commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::ball(0.5)));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In addition, Bevy XPBD will automatically add some other components, like the following:
///
/// - [`ColliderAabb`]
/// - [`CollidingEntities`]
/// - [`ColliderMassProperties`]
///
/// ## Collision layers
///
/// You can use collsion layers to configure which entities can collide with each other.
///
/// See [`CollisionLayers`] for more information and examples.
///
/// ## Collision events
///
/// There are currently three different collision events: [`Collision`], [`CollisionStarted`] and [`CollisionEnded`].
/// You can listen to these events as you normally would.
///
/// For example, you could read [contacts](Contact) like this:
///
/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
///
/// fn my_system(mut collision_event_reader: EventReader<Collision>) {
///     for Collision(contact) in collision_event_reader.iter() {
///         println!("{:?} and {:?} are colliding", contact.entity1, contact.entity2);
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Advanced usage
///
/// Internally, `Collider` uses the shapes provided by `parry`. If you want to create a collider
/// using these shapes, you can simply use `Collider::from(SharedShape::some_method())`.
///
/// To get a reference to the internal [`SharedShape`], you can use the [`get_shape`](#method.get_shape) method.
