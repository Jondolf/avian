/// A non-deformable body used for the simulation of most physics objects.
///
/// A rigid body can be either dynamic, kinematic or static.
///
/// - **Dynamic bodies** are similar to real life objects and are affected by forces and contacts.
/// - **Kinematic bodies** can only be moved programmatically, which is useful for things like character controllers and moving platforms.
/// - **Static bodies** can not move, so they can be good for objects in the environment like the ground and walls.
///
/// ## Creation
///
/// Creating a rigid body is as simple as adding the [`RigidBody`] component:
///
/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;
///
/// fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
///     commands.spawn(RigidBody::Dynamic);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Bevy XPBD will automatically add any missing components, like the following:
///
/// - [`Position`]
/// - [`Rotation`]
/// - [`LinearVelocity`]
/// - [`AngularVelocity`]
/// - [`ExternalForce`]
/// - [`ExternalTorque`]
/// - [`Friction`]
/// - [`Restitution`]
/// - [`Mass`]
/// - [`Inertia`]
/// - [`CenterOfMass`]
///
/// You can change any of these during initialization and runtime in order to alter the behaviour of the body.
///
/// Note that by default, rigid bodies don't have any mass, so dynamic bodies will gain infinite velocity upon any interaction.
/// See the [section below](#adding-mass-properties) for how to add mass properties.
///
/// ## Adding mass properties
///
/// You should always give dynamic rigid bodies mass properties. The easiest way to do this is to [add a collider](Collider), since colliders
/// by default have [their own mass properties](ColliderMassProperties) that are added to the body's own mass properties.
///
/// ```ignore
/// // The mass properties will be computed from a ball shape with a radius of 0.5 and a density of 1.
/// commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::ball(0.5)));
/// ```
///
/// If you don't want to add a collider, you can instead add a [`MassPropertiesBundle`] with the mass properties computed from a collider
/// shape using the [`MassPropertiesBundle::new_computed`](MassPropertiesBundle#method.new_computed) method.
///
/// ```ignore
/// // This is equivalent to the earlier approach, but no collider will be added.
/// commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, MassPropertiesBundle::new_computed(&Collider::ball(0.5), 1.0)));
/// ```
///
/// If you want, you can also define the mass properties explicitly by adding the components manually.
/// Note that the mass properties of colliders are added on top of the existing mass properties, so if you
/// want to define the body's mass properties explicitly, you might want to add
/// [`ColliderMassProperties::ZERO`](ColliderMassProperties#associatedconstant.ZERO) to the colliders.
