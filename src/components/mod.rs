/// A non-deformable body used for the simulation of most physics objects.
///
/// ## Rigid body types
///
/// A rigid body can be either dynamic, kinematic or static.
///
/// - **Dynamic bodies** are similar to real life objects and are affected by forces and contacts.
/// - **Kinematic bodies** can only be moved programmatically, which is useful for things like character controllers and moving platforms.
/// - **Static bodies** can not move, so they can be good for objects in the environment like the ground and walls.
///
/// ## Creation
///
/// Creating a rigid body is as simple as adding the [`RigidBody`] component:
///
/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
///
/// fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
///     // Spawn a dynamic rigid body and specify its position (optional)
///     commands.spawn((
///         RigidBody::Dynamic,
///         TransformBundle::from_transform(Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 3.0, 0.0)),
///     ));
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Bevy XPBD will automatically add any missing components, like the following:
///
/// - [`Position`]
/// - [`Rotation`]
/// - [`LinearVelocity`]
/// - [`AngularVelocity`]
/// - [`ExternalForce`]
/// - [`ExternalTorque`]
/// - [`ExternalImpulse`]
/// - [`ExternalAngularImpulse`]
/// - [`Friction`]
/// - [`Restitution`]
/// - [`Mass`]
/// - [`Inertia`]
/// - [`CenterOfMass`]
///
/// You can change any of these during initialization and runtime in order to alter the behaviour of the body.
///
/// Note that by default, rigid bodies don't have any mass, so dynamic bodies can
/// gain infinite velocity during interactions. See [mass properties](#mass-properties).
///
/// ## Movement
///
/// A rigid body can be moved in three ways: by modifying its position directly,
/// by changing its velocity, or by applying forces or impulses.
///
/// To change the position of a rigid body, you can simply modify its `Transform`:
///
/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
///
/// fn move_bodies(mut query: Query<&mut Transform, With<RigidBody>>) {
///     for mut transform in query.iter_mut() {
///         transform.translation.x += 0.1;
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// However, moving a dynamic body by changing its position directly is similar
/// to teleporting the body, which can result in unexpected behavior since the body can move
/// inside walls.
///
/// You can instead change the velocity of a dynamic or kinematic body with the [`LinearVelocity`]
/// and [`AngularVelocity`] components:
///
/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
///
/// fn accelerate_bodies(mut query: Query<(&mut LinearVelocity, &mut AngularVelocity)>) {
///     for (mut linear_velocity, mut angular_velocity) in query.iter_mut() {
///         linear_velocity.x += 0.05;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "        angular_velocity.0 += 0.05;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "        angular_velocity.z += 0.05;")]
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// For applying forces and impulses to dynamic bodies, see the [`ExternalForce`], [`ExternalTorque`],
/// [`ExternalImpulse`] and [`ExternalAngularImpulse`] components.
///
/// Bevy XPBD does not have a built-in character controller, so if you need one,
/// you will need to implement it yourself or use a third party option.
/// You can take a look at the [`basic_dynamic_character`] and [`basic_kinematic_character`]
/// examples for a simple implementation.
///
/// [`basic_dynamic_character`]: https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd/blob/42fb8b21c756a7f4dd91071597dc251245ddaa8f/crates/bevy_xpbd_3d/examples/basic_dynamic_character.rs

///
/// ## Mass properties
///
/// The mass properties of a rigid body consist of its [`Mass`], [`Inertia`]
/// and local [`CenterOfMass`]. They control how forces and torques impact a rigid body
/// and how it affects other bodies.
///
/// You should always give dynamic rigid bodies mass properties so that forces
/// are applied to them correctly. The easiest way to do that is to simply [add a collider](Collider):
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
/// #
/// # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
/// commands.spawn((RigidBody::Dynamic, Collider::ball(0.5)));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// This will automatically compute the [collider's mass properties](ColliderMassProperties)
/// and add them to the body's own mass properties.
///
/// By default, each collider has a density of `1.0`. This can be configured with
/// the [`ColliderDensity`] component:
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]

/// commands.spawn((
///     RigidBody::Dynamic,
///     Collider::ball(0.5),
///     ColliderDensity(2.5),
/// ));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// If you don't want to add a collider, you can instead add a [`MassPropertiesBundle`]
/// with the mass properties computed from a collider shape using the
/// [`MassPropertiesBundle::new_computed`](MassPropertiesBundle::new_computed) method.
///
/// ```
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
#[cfg_attr(feature = "2d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;")]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "3d", doc = "# use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;")]
/// #
/// # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
/// // This is equivalent to the earlier approach, but no collider will be added
/// commands.spawn((
///     RigidBody::Dynamic,
///     MassPropertiesBundle::new_computed(&Collider::ball(0.5), 2.5),
/// ));
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// You can also specify the exact values of the mass properties by adding the components manually.
/// To avoid the collider mass properties from being added to the body's own mass properties,
/// you can simply set the collider's density to zero.
///
/// ```
