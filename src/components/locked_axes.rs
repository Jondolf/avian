/// The axes are represented using a total of six bits, one for each axis. The easiest way is to lock or unlock
/// specific axes is to use the methods like [`lock_translation_x`](#method.lock_translation_x), but you can also
/// use bits directly with the [`from_bits`](#method.from_bits) and [`to_bits`](#method.to_bits) methods.

/// ## Example

/// ```
/// use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "2d")]
/// # use bevy_xpbd_2d::prelude::*;
/// # #[cfg(feature = "3d")]
/// use bevy_xpbd_3d::prelude::*;

///         RigidBody::Dynamic,
///         Collider::capsule(1.0, 0.5),
