**Avian** is an ECS-driven 2D and 3D physics engine for the [Bevy game engine](https://bevyengine.org/).

---

## Design

Below are some of the core design principles used in Avian.

- **Made with Bevy, for Bevy.** No wrappers around existing engines.
- **Provide an ergonomic and familiar API.** Ergonomics is key for a good experience.
- **Utilize the ECS as much as possible.** The engine should feel like a part of Bevy, and it shouldn't
    need to maintain a separate physics world.
- **Use a highly modular plugin architecture.** Users should be able to replace parts of the engine
    with their own implementations.
- **Have good documentation.** A physics engine is pointless if you don't know how to use it.

## Features

Below are some of the current features of Avian.

- Dynamic, kinematic and static rigid bodies
  - Linear and angular velocity
  - External forces, torque and impulses
  - Gravity and gravity scale
  - Linear and angular damping
  - Locking translational and rotational axes
  - Rigid body dominance
  - Continuous Collision Detection (CCD)
  - Automatic deactivation with sleeping
- Collision detection powered by [Parry](https://parry.rs)
  - Colliders with configurable collision layers, density, material properties and more
  - Collider generation for meshes and entire scenes
  - Collision events
  - Access to colliding entities
  - Filtering and modifying collisions with custom systems
  - Manual contact queries and intersection tests
- Constraints and joints
  - Several built-in joint types: fixed, distance, prismatic, revolute, spherical
  - Support for custom joints and other constraints using XPBD
- Spatial queries
  - Raycasting, shapecasting, point projection and intersection tests
  - Ergonomic component-based API for raycasts and shapecasts
  - Flexible `SpatialQuery` system parameter
  - Spatial query filters
- `Transform` interpolation and extrapolation for fixed timesteps
- Debug rendering for colliders, AABBs, contacts, joints, sleeping, axes and spatial queries
- Configurable scheduling and high customizability
- Highly modular plugin architecture, freely extend and replace parts of the engine
- Support for custom collision backends
- `f32`/`f64` precision (`f32` by default)

You can find a more complete list along with documentation in the
[Table of Contents](https://docs.rs/avian3d/latest/avian3d/#table-of-contents)
on docs.rs.

## Documentation

- [2D documentation](https://docs.rs/avian2d)
- [3D documentation](https://docs.rs/avian3d)

## Usage Example

First, add `avian2d` or `avian3d` to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# For 2D applications:
[dependencies]
avian2d = "0.2"

# For 3D applications:
[dependencies]
avian3d = "0.2"

# If you want to use the most up-to-date version, you can follow the main branch:
[dependencies]
avian3d = { git = "https://github.com/Jondolf/avian", branch = "main" }
```

Below is a very simple example where a cube with initial angular velocity falls onto a circular platform.
This is a modified version of Bevy's [`3d_scene`](https://bevyengine.org/examples/3d-rendering/3d-scene/) example.

```rust
use avian3d::prelude::*;
use bevy::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        // Enable physics
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, PhysicsPlugins::default()))
        .add_systems(Startup, setup)
        .run();
}

fn setup(
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,
    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,
) {
    // Static physics object with a collision shape
    commands.spawn((
        RigidBody::Static,
        Collider::cylinder(4.0, 0.1),
        Mesh3d(meshes.add(Cylinder::new(4.0, 0.1))),
        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(Color::WHITE)),
    ));

    // Dynamic physics object with a collision shape and initial angular velocity
    commands.spawn((
        RigidBody::Dynamic,
        Collider::cuboid(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
        AngularVelocity(Vec3::new(2.5, 3.5, 1.5)),
        Mesh3d(meshes.add(Cuboid::from_length(1.0))),
        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(Color::srgb_u8(124, 144, 255))),
        Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 4.0, 0.0),
    ));

    // Light
    commands.spawn((
        PointLight {
            shadows_enabled: true,
            ..default()
        },
        Transform::from_xyz(4.0, 8.0, 4.0),
    ));

    // Camera
    commands.spawn((
        Camera3d::default(),
        Transform::from_xyz(-2.5, 4.5, 9.0).looking_at(Vec3::ZERO, Dir3::Y),
    ));
}
```

## More Examples

You can find lots of 2D and 3D examples in [/crates/avian2d/examples](/crates/avian2d/examples) and [/crates/avian3d/examples](/crates/avian3d/examples) respectively.

The examples support both `f32` and `f64` precisions, so the code contains some feature-dependent types like `Scalar` and `Vector`.
In actual usage these are not needed, so you can just use `f32` or `f64` types depending on the features you have chosen.

By default the examples use `f32`. To run the `f64` versions, you need to disable default features and manually choose the dimension
and precision:

```shell
# Manually specify dimension and precision. `parry-f64` enables collision detection using Parry.
cargo run --example cubes --no-default-features --features "3d f64 parry-f64"
```

- Joint motors
- Articulations, aka. multibody joints
- Proper cross-platform determinism
- Soft bodies (cloth and deformable solids)
- Maybe fluid simulation

## Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to the entire Bevy community for the incredible support!
All of your contributions, insight and requests are a massive help
in driving the state of physics in Bevy forward, and it's what
keeps me motivated to build the best engine I can.

I would also like to give a special thanks to [Johan Helsing][johan-helsing]
for inspiring this project and helping me significantly in the early stages.
His original [tutorial series][johan-xpbd-tutorial] is the reason `avian`
exists in the first place, and without his support and contributions,
the project wouldn't be anywhere near where it is today.
